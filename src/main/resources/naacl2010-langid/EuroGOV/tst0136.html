        <p>(2003/514/EC)</p>
        <p>THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 806/2003(2), and in particular Article 9 thereof,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market(3), as last amended by Directive 2002/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(4), and in particular Article 10 thereof,</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) Commission Decision 95/108/EC of 28 March 1995 concerning health protection measures against African swine fever in Sardinia, Italy(5) has been substantially amended(6). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Decision should be codified.</p>
        <p>(2) African swine fever must be considered an endemic disease in the province of Nuoro, Sardinia, Italy.</p>
        <p>(3) The disease situation is liable to endanger the herds in other regions of Italy and of other Member States, in view of trade in live pigs, fresh pigmeat and certain pigmeat-based products.</p>
        <p>(4) Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 806/2003, provides for the possibility of financial participation by the Community in the eradication and surveillance of animal diseases.</p>
        <p>(5) It is the objective within the context of the African swine fever eradication programmes presented annually by Italy for approval to eliminate that disease from the remaining infected areas of Sardinia.</p>
        <p>(6) The Italian authorities have taken legal measures to prohibit the movement of live pigs, fresh pigmeat and certain pigmeat-based products from the territory of Sardinia. The adoption of those legal measures guarantees the efficacity of the implementation of this Decision.</p>
        <p>(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>
        <p>HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>

        <p>1. Italy prohibits the movement of fresh pigmeat originating from any animal of the Suidae family from the territory of the region of Sardinia.</p>
        <p>2. In derogation from the provisions of paragraph 1 fresh pigmeat can be sent to areas outside the territory of the region of Sardinia on condition that the meat in question:</p>
