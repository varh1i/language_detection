        <p>Commission Regulation (EC) No 656/2004</p>
        <p>of 7 April 2004</p>
        <p>amending Regulation (EEC) No 752/93 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3911/92 on the export of cultural goods</p>
        <p>THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3911/92 on the export of cultural goods(1), and in particular Article 7 thereof,</p>
        <p>After consulting the Advisory Committee on Cultural Goods,</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 752/93 of 30 March 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3911/92 on the export of cultural goods(2), made provision for a model export licence form applicable to categories of cultural goods listed in annex to Regulation (EEC) No 3911/92. However, this form is not consistent with the United Nations Layout Key for Trade Documents and in practice its use causes some problems.</p>
        <p>(2) Therefore a new model form conforming to the United Nations Layout Key for Trade Documents should be drawn up. The form should also be accompanied by explanatory notes to help interested parties to draw it up uniformly and correctly.</p>
        <p>(3) Regulation (EEC) No 752/93 stipulates that the form should be filled in by mechanical or electronic means or by hand. However, in order to reduce the administrative costs, Member States which so wish and have the necessary technical means should be allowed to issue the document by electronic means.</p>
        <p>(4) To ensure that the issuing authority receives sheet 3 of the form, provision should be made for the customs office of exit from the Community customs territory to return this sheet directly to the issuing authority instead of giving it to the exporter or his/her representative, as provided for at present.</p>
        <p>(5) Regulation (EEC) No 752/93 should therefore be amended accordingly,</p>
        <p>HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
        <p>Article 1</p>
        <p>Regulation (EEC) No 752/93 is amended as follows:</p>
        <p>1. In Article 3(3), the opening sentence is replaced by the following:</p>
        <p>%quot%3. Forms shall be produced in printed or electronic form and filled out in an official language of the Communities designated by the competent authorities of the issuing Member State.%quot%</p>
        <p>2. In Article 6(1), the opening sentence is replaced by the following:</p>
        <p>%quot%1. The applicant shall complete boxes 1, 3, 6 to 21, 24 and, if necessary, 25 of the application and the other sheets except where pre-printing of the box or boxes is authorised.%quot%</p>
        <p>3. Article 8 is amended as follows:</p>
        <p>(a) the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:</p>
        <p>%quot%1. The customs office responsible for handling the export declaration shall ensure that the entries on the export declaration or, if applicable, the ATA carnet, correspond to the entries on the export licence and that a reference to the export licence is entered in box 44 of the export declaration or on the counterfoil of the ATA carnet.%quot%</p>
        <p>(b) Paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:</p>
        <p>%quot%2. After completing box 23 in copies 2 and 3, the customs office authorised to accept the export declaration shall return to the declarant or to his/her authorised representative the sheet intended for the holder.%quot%</p>
        <p>(c) In paragraph 3, the last sentence is replaced by the following:%quot%The customs office shall affix its stamp to box 26 of the form and return it to the issuing authority.%quot%</p>
        <p>4. In Article 16(3), the opening sentence is replaced by the following:</p>
        <p>%quot%3. The licence form shall be produced in printed or electronic form in one or more of the official languages of the Community.%quot%</p>
        <p>5. Annex I is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation.</p>
        <p>Article 2</p>
        <p>Export licences issued up to 30 June 2004 shall remain valid until 30 June 2005.</p>
        <p>Article 3</p>
        <p>This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
        <p>It shall apply from 1 July 2004.</p>
        <p>This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>

        <p>EXPLANATORY NOTES</p>
        <p>1. General</p>
        <p>1.1. Licences are required for the export of cultural goods to protect the cultural heritage of the Member States pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 3911/92 of 9 December 1992.</p>
        <p>Commission Regulation (EEC) No 752/93 of 30 March 1993 sets out the form in which standard export licences are to be drawn up. It is intended to guarantee standardised checks on the export of cultural goods outside the Community's borders.</p>
        <p>Commission Regulation (EC) No 1526/98 of 16 July 1998 provided for two other types of export licence, namely:</p>
        <p>- specific open licences, to be issued for specific cultural goods which are liable to be temporarily exported from the Community on a regular basis for use and/or exhibition in a third country,</p>
        <p>- general open licences, to be issued to museums or other institutions to cover the temporary export of any of the goods that belong to their permanent collections that are liable to be temporarily exported from the Community on a regular basis for exhibition in a third country.</p>
        <p>1.2. Three copies of the standard export licence form must be completed legibly and indelibly, preferably by mechanical or electronic means. If they are handwritten, they must be completed in ink and in capital letters. They must under no circumstances contain erasures, overwritten words or other alterations.</p>
        <p>1.3. Any unused box must be lined crossed out so that nothing can be added.</p>
        <p>The copies can be identified by their numbering and function, indicated in the left-hand margin. They should be ordered in the set as follows:</p>
        <p>- Copy No 1: application to be kept by the issuing authority (indicate in each Member State the identity of that authority); in the case of additional lists, as many copies of No 1 as necessary must be used; it is up to the competent issuing authorities to establish whether more than one export licence should be issued,</p>
        <p>- Copy No 2: to be presented in support of the export declaration at the competent customs office of export and kept by the licence holder after it has been stamped by that office,</p>
        <p>- Copy No 3: to be presented at the competent customs office of export and to accompany the consignment thereafter until its arrival at the customs office of exit from the Community; the customs office of exit stamps this copy and then returns it to the issuing authority.</p>
