        <p>Commission Decision</p>
        <p>of 14 July 2005,</p>
        <p>amending Decision 2004/292/EC on the introduction of the Traces system and amending Decision 92/486/EEC</p>
        <p>(notified under document number C(2005) 2663)</p>

        <p>THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market [1], and in particular Article 20(3) thereof,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Decision 92/438/EEC of 13 July 1992 on computerisation of veterinary import procedures (Shift project), amending Directives 90/675/EEC, 91/496/EEC, 91/628/EEC and Decision 90/424/EEC and repealing Decision 88/192/EEC [2], and in particular Article 12 thereof,</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) Commission Decision 2004/292/EC of 30 March 2004 on the introduction of the Traces system and amending Decision 92/486/EEC [3] provides for entry into the Traces system of all common veterinary entry documents for products from 30 June 2005.</p>
        <p>(2) There is a delay in making available an off-line system for data entry to cope with this huge increase in workload, and in developing an interface allowing communication between national systems and Traces.</p>
        <p>(3) The training by the Member States of freight forwarders to ensure that they play an active part in entering data into the Traces system will take some time.</p>
        <p>(4) The date in Decision 2004/292/EC from which entry into the Traces system of all common veterinary entry documents for products is compulsory should therefore be deferred.</p>
        <p>(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>
        <p>HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
        <p>Article 1</p>
        <p>In Article 3(3) of Decision 2004/292/EC, " 30 June 2005" is replaced by " 31 December 2005".</p>
        <p>Article 2</p>
        <p>This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
