      <head>Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 of 20 February 2006 establishing a temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry in the Community and amending Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy</head>
      <div type="body">
        <p>Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006</p>
        <p>of 20 February 2006</p>
        <p>establishing a temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry in the Community and amending Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy</p>
        <p>THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 36 and the third subparagraph of Article 37(2) thereof,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Opinion from the European Parliament [1],</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Opinion from the European Economic and Social Committee [2],</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) Due to developments within the Community and at international level, the sugar industry in the Community is faced with structural problems which could seriously put at stake the competitiveness and even the viability of the industry as a whole. These problems cannot be addressed effectively by using the market management instruments as provided for in the common market organisation for sugar. To bring the Community system of sugar production and trading in line with international requirements and ensure its competitiveness in the future it is necessary to launch a profound restructuring process leading to a significant reduction of unprofitable production capacity in the Community. To this end, as a precondition for the implementation of a functioning new common market organisation for sugar a separate and autonomous temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry in the Community should be established. Under this scheme quotas should be reduced in a manner that takes account of the legitimate interests of the sugar industry, sugar beet, cane and chicory growers and consumers in the Community.</p>
        <p>(2) A temporary restructuring fund should be set up in order to finance the restructuring measures for the Community sugar industry. For reasons of sound financial management the fund should form part of the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF and thus be governed by the procedures and mechanisms of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy [3] and, as from 1 January 2007, of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund set up by Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy [4].</p>
        <p>(3) Owing to the fact that outermost regions are currently the object of development programmes aimed at improving their competitiveness in raw sugar production and also produce raw cane sugar in competition with third countries, which are not subject to the temporary restructuring amount, undertakings in the outermost regions should not fall under the scope of this Regulation.</p>
        <p>(4) The restructuring measures provided for by this Regulation should be financed by raising temporary amounts from those sugar, isoglucose and inulin syrup producers which will eventually benefit from the restructuring process. As this amount falls outside the scope of the charges traditionally known in the framework of the common market organisation for sugar, the proceeds resulting from its collection should be considered as %quot%assigned revenue%quot% as provided for by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities [5].</p>
        <p>(5) An important economic incentive for sugar undertakings with the lowest productivity to give up their quota production in the form of an adequate restructuring aid should be introduced. To this effect, a restructuring aid should be set up that creates an incentive to abandon sugar quota production and renounce the quotas concerned, at the same time allowing to take into due account the respect of social and environmental commitments linked to the abandoning of production. The aid should be available during four marketing years with the aim to reduce production to the extent necessary to reach a balanced market situation in the Community.</p>
        <p>(6) To support sugar beet, cane and chicory growers that have to give up production due to the closure of factories they had supplied previously, a part of the restructuring aid should be made available to these growers as well as to machinery contractors that have worked for these growers in order to compensate for losses resulting from these closures and in particular the loss of value of investments in specialised machinery.</p>
        <p>(7) As payments of the restructuring amount into the temporary restructuring fund are made over a certain period of time, it is necessary that payments of the restructuring aid are spread in time.</p>
        <p>(8) The decision as to the granting of the restructuring aid should be taken by the Member State concerned. Undertakings prepared to renounce their quotas should submit an application to this Member State providing the latter with all the relevant information in order to enable it to reach a decision on the aid. Member States should have the possibility to impose certain social and environmental requirements in order to take account of the particularities of the case presented as long as these requirements do not restrict the operation of the restructuring process.</p>
        <p>(9) A restructuring plan should form part of the application for restructuring aid. This plan should provide the Member State concerned with all the relevant technical, social, environmental and financial information allowing it to decide on the granting of the restructuring aid. Member States should take the necessary measures in order to exercise the necessary control over the implementation of all of the elements of the restructuring.</p>
        <p>(10) In the regions concerned by the restructuring process it might prove to be appropriate to encourage the development of alternatives to sugar beet and cane growing and sugar production. To this effect, Member States should have the possibility to allocate a certain part of the money available from the restructuring fund to diversification measures. These measures, established in the context of a national restructuring plan, may take the form of measures identical to certain measures supported under Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) [6] or to measures that are in conformity with Community law regarding State aid.</p>
        <p>(11) In order to speed up the process of restructuring, the aid available for diversification should be increased if the quotas renounced go beyond certain levels.</p>
        <p>(12) Full-time refiners should have the possibility to adapt their situation to the restructuring of the sugar industry. The adaptation should be supported by means of an aid from the restructuring fund provided that the Member State approves the business plan providing for the adaptation. Member States concerned should ensure an equitable break down of the aid available among the full-time refiners on their territory.</p>
        <p>(13) Some specific situations in certain Member States should be taken care of by means of an aid from the restructuring fund provided that it forms part of the national restructuring programme.</p>
        <p>(14) As it is to be funded over a period of three years, the restructuring fund does not dispose from the outset of all the necessary financial means. Rules as to the limitation of the granting of the aid should therefore be established.</p>
        <p>(15) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [7].</p>
        <p>(16) The Commission should be authorised to adopt necessary measures to solve specific practical problems in the case of emergency.</p>
        <p>(17) The restructuring fund will finance measures which, due to the nature of the restructuring mechanism, do not fall under the categories of expenditure referred to in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. It is therefore necessary to amend that Regulation accordingly,</p>

        <p>4. Notwithstanding the control obligations referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, Member States shall monitor, control and verify the implementation of the restructuring aid as approved by it.</p>
        <p>Article 6</p>
        <p>Aid for diversification</p>
        <p>1. An aid for diversification measures in regions affected by the restructuring of the sugar industry may be granted in any Member State in relation to the sugar quota renounced by undertakings established in that Member State in one of the marketing years 2006/2007, 2007/2008, 2008/2009 and 2009/2010.</p>
        <p>2. The total amount of aid available to a Member State shall be established on the basis of:</p>
        <p>- EUR 109,50 per tonne of sugar quota renounced in the marketing year 2006/2007,</p>
        <p>- EUR 109,50 per tonne of sugar quota renounced in the marketing year 2007/2008,</p>
        <p>- EUR 93,80 per tonne of sugar quota renounced in the marketing year 2008/2009,</p>
        <p>- EUR 78,00 per tonne of sugar quota renounced in the marketing year 2009/2010.</p>
        <p>3. Member States which decide to grant aid for diversification referred to in paragraph 1 or transitional aid referred to in Article 9 shall establish national restructuring programmes detailing the diversification measures to be undertaken in the regions concerned and inform the Commission of these programmes.</p>
        <p>4. Notwithstanding paragraph 5, to be eligible for aid referred to in paragraph 1 diversification measures shall correspond to one or more of the measures envisaged under Axis 1 and Axis 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005.</p>
        <p>Member States shall fix criteria in order to distinguish the measures for which an aid for diversification may be granted from the measures for which Community support may be granted under Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005.</p>
        <p>The aid referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be higher than the ceilings for the EAFRD contribution laid down in Article 70(3)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005.</p>
        <p>5. Diversification measures which differ from the measures envisaged under Axis 1 and Axis 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 shall be eligible for the aid referred to in paragraph 1 provided that they are in conformity with the criteria set out in Article 87(3) of the Treaty and, in particular, with the aid intensities and the eligibility criteria laid down in the Commission guidelines on State aid in the agricultural sector.</p>
        <p>6. Member States shall not grant national aid in respect of diversification measures provided for in this Article. However, if the ceilings referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 4 were to permit the granting of an aid for diversification of 100 %, the Member State concerned shall contribute at least 20 % of the eligible expenditure. In this case, Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaty shall not apply.</p>
        <p>Article 7</p>
        <p>Additional aid for diversification</p>
        <p>1. The total amount of aid available to a Member State in accordance with Article 6(2) shall be increased by:</p>
        <p>- 50 % once the national sugar quota fixed in Annex III of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 for that Member State has been renounced by at least 50 % but less than 75 %,</p>
        <p>- another 25 % once the national sugar quota fixed in Annex III of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 for that Member State has been renounced by at least 75 % but less than 100 %,</p>
        <p>- another 25 % once the national sugar quota fixed in Annex III of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 for that Member State has been completely renounced.</p>
        <p>Any increase shall be available in the marketing year in which the quantity of the national sugar quota renounced reaches, as the case may be, 50, 75 or 100 %.</p>
        <p>2. The Member State concerned shall decide whether the aid corresponding to the increase laid down in paragraph 1 shall be granted for diversification measures referred to in Article 6(1) and/or to growers of sugar beet or cane giving up their production in the regions affected by the restructuring. The aid to growers shall be granted according to objective and non-discriminatory criteria.</p>
        <p>Article 8</p>
        <p>Transitional aid to full-time refiners</p>
        <p>1. A transitional aid shall be granted to full-time refiners so as to allow them to adapt to the restructuring of the sugar industry in the Community.</p>
        <p>2. To this end, an amount of EUR 150 million shall be made available for the total of the four marketing years 2006/2007, 2007/2008, 2008/2009 and 2009/2010.</p>
        <p>The amount fixed in the first subparagraph shall be divided as follows:</p>
        <p>- EUR 94,3 million for full-time refiners in the United Kingdom,</p>
        <p>- EUR 24,4 million for full-time refiners in Portugal,</p>
        <p>- EUR 5,0 million for full-time refiners in Finland,</p>
        <p>- EUR 24,8 million for full-time refiners in France,</p>
