        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Directive 89/106/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to construction products(1), as amended by Directive 93/68/EEC(2), and in particular Article 20(2) thereof,</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) Commission Decision 2000/367/EC of 3 May 2000 implementing Council Directive 89/106/EEC as regards the classification of the resistance-to-fire performance of construction products, construction works and parts thereof(3) should, for the purposes of its adaptation to technical progress, also cover smoke and heat control products.</p>
        <p>(2) Decision 2000/367/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
        <p>(3) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Construction,</p>
        <p>HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>

        <p>The Annex to Decision 2000/367/EC is amended as follows.</p>
        <p>1. The section entitled %quot%SYMBOLS%quot% is amended as follows:</p>
        <p>(a) in the table, the following rows are added:</p>
        <p>%quot%%gt%TABLE%gt%%quot%</p>
        <p>(b) in note 2, %quot%EN 13501-4%quot% is inserted after %quot%EN 13501-3%quot%.</p>
        <p>2. The section entitled %quot%Classifications%quot% is amended as follows:</p>
        <p>(a) point 2 is amended as follows:</p>
        <p>(i) in the table applying to walls, classes RE360, REI360, REI-M360 and REW360 are added;</p>
        <p>(ii) in the classification part of the table applying to floors and roofs:</p>
        <p>- above row %quot%RE%quot%, a new row %quot%R%quot% is inserted with class R30,</p>
        <p>- classes RE360 and REI360 are added;</p>
        <p>(b) in point 3 the words %quot%fire protective coatings, claddings and screens%quot% are replaced by the words %quot%fire protective coatings, boards, renderings, claddings and screens%quot%;</p>
        <p>(c) point 4 is amended as follows:</p>
        <p>(i) in the table applying to %quot%partitions (including those incorporating uninsulated portions)%quot%, classes EI-M180 and EI-M240 are added;</p>
        <p>(ii) in the table applying to %quot%closures for conveyors and trackbound transportation systems%quot%, the text relating to %quot%Notes%quot% is replaced by the following: %quot%The I classification is completed by the addition of the suffix '1' or '2' to indicate which definition of insulation is used. An I classification shall be generated for those cases where the test specimen is a pipe or duct configuration with no assessment of the closure for the conveyor system. The addition of the symbol 'C' indicates that the product also satisfies the 'self-closing' criterion (pass/fail test) (*).%quot%;</p>
        <p>(iii) the table applying to %quot%wall and ceiling coverings%quot% is replaced by the following:</p>
        <p>%quot%%gt%TABLE%gt%</p>
        <p>Notes</p>
        <p>The suffixes '1' and '2' indicate which substrates, fire behaviour criteria and extension rules are used in this classification.%quot%</p>
        <p>(d) the following point 7 is added:</p>
