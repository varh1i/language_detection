      <div type="body">
        <p>Agreement</p>
        <p>between the European Community and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay on certain aspects of air services</p>
        <p>THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY,</p>
        <p>of the one part,</p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p>THE ORIENTAL REPUBLIC OF URUGUAY (hereinafter referred to as Uruguay),</p>
        <p>of the other part,</p>
        <p>(hereinafter referred to as the Parties),</p>
        <p>NOTING that bilateral air service agreements have been signed between several Member States of the European Community and Uruguay containing provisions contrary to European Community law,</p>
        <p>NOTING that the European Community has exclusive competence with respect to several aspects that may be included in bilateral air service agreements between Member States of the European Community and third countries,</p>
        <p>NOTING that under European Community law Community air carriers established in a Member State have the right to non-discriminatory access to air routes between the Member States of the European Community and third countries,</p>
        <p>HAVING REGARD to the agreements between the European Community and certain third States providing for the possibility for the nationals of such third States to acquire ownership in air carriers licensed in accordance with European Community law,</p>
        <p>RECOGNISING that certain provisions of the bilateral air service agreements between Member States of the European Community and Uruguay, which are contrary to European Community law, must be brought into conformity with it in order to establish a sound legal basis for air services between the European Community and Uruguay and to preserve the continuity of such air services,</p>
        <p>NOTING that under European Community law air carriers may not, in principle, conclude agreements which may affect trade between Member States of the European Community and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition,</p>
        <p>RECOGNISING that, in the light of the above, provisions in bilateral air service agreements concluded between Member States of the European Community and Uruguay which (i) require or favour the adoption of agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings or concerted practices that prevent, distort or restrict competition between air carriers on the relevant routes; or (ii) reinforce the effects of any such agreement, decision or concerted practice; or (iii) delegate to air carriers or other private economic operators the responsibility for taking measures that prevent, distort or restrict competition between air carriers on the relevant routes may render ineffective the competition rules applicable to undertakings,</p>
        <p>NOTING that it is not a purpose of the European Community to affect the balance between Community air carriers and air carriers of Uruguay, or to negotiate amendments to the provisions of existing bilateral air service agreements concerning traffic rights,</p>
        <p>HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
        <p>Article 1</p>
        <p>General provisions</p>
        <p>1. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Member States" shall mean Member States of the European Community. "LACAC Member States" shall mean Member States of the Latin American Civil Aviation Commission.</p>
        <p>2. References in each of the agreements listed in Annex I to nationals of the Member State that is a party to that agreement shall be understood as referring to nationals of the Member States.</p>
        <p>3. References in each of the agreements listed in Annex I to air carriers or airlines of the Member State that is a party to that agreement shall be understood as referring to air carriers or airlines designated by that Member State.</p>
        <p>Article 2</p>
        <p>Designation and limitation of authorisations</p>
        <p>1. The provisions in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article shall supersede the corresponding provisions in the Articles listed in Annex II(a) and (b) respectively, in relation to the designation of an air carrier by the Member State concerned, its authorisations and permissions granted by Uruguay, and the refusal, revocation, suspension or limitation of the authorisations or permissions of the air carrier, respectively. The provisions in paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article shall supersede the corresponding provisions in the Articles listed in Annex II(a) and (b) respectively, in relation to the designation of an air carrier by Uruguay, its authorisations and permissions granted by the Member State, and the refusal, revocation, suspension or limitation of the authorisations or permissions of the air carrier, respectively.</p>
        <p>2. On receipt of a designation by a Member State, Uruguay shall grant the appropriate authorisations and permissions with minimum procedural delay, provided that:</p>
        <p>(i) the air carrier is established in the territory, under the Treaty establishing the European Community, of the designating Member State and has a valid Operating Licence in accordance with European Community law; and</p>
        <p>(ii) effective regulatory control of the air carrier is exercised and maintained by the Member State responsible for issuing its Air Operators Certificate and the relevant aeronautical authority is clearly identified in the designation; and</p>
        <p>(iii) the air carrier is owned, directly or through majority ownership, and it is effectively controlled by Member States and/or nationals of Member States, or by other States listed in Annex III and/or nationals of such other States.</p>
        <p>3. Uruguay may refuse, revoke, suspend or limit the authorisations or permissions of an air carrier designated by a Member State where:</p>
        <p>(i) the air carrier is not established, under the Treaty establishing the European Community, in the territory of the designating Member State or does not have a valid Operating Licence in accordance with European Community law; or</p>
        <p>(ii) effective regulatory control of the air carrier is not exercised or not maintained by the Member State responsible for issuing its Air Operators Certificate, or the relevant aeronautical authority is not clearly identified in the designation; or</p>
        <p>(iii) the air carrier is not owned and effectively controlled directly or through majority ownership by Member States and/or nationals of Member States, or by other States listed in Annex III and/or nationals of such other States; or</p>
        <p>(iv) Uruguay demonstrates that, by exercising traffic rights under this Agreement on a route that includes a point in another Member State, the airline would be circumventing restrictions on traffic rights imposed by a bilateral agreement between Uruguay and that other Member State; or</p>
        <p>(v) the airline holds an Air Operators Certificate issued by a Member State and there is no bilateral air services agreement between Uruguay and that Member State, and traffic rights to that Member State have been denied to the air carrier designated by Uruguay.</p>
        <p>In exercising its right under this paragraph, Uruguay shall not discriminate between Community air carriers on the grounds of nationality.</p>
        <p>4. On receipt of a designation by Uruguay, a Member State shall grant the appropriate authorisations and permissions with minimum procedural delay, provided that:</p>
        <p>(i) the air carrier is established in the territory of Uruguay; and</p>
        <p>(ii) Uruguay has and maintains effective regulatory control of the airline and is responsible for issuing its Air Operators Certificate; and</p>
        <p>(iii) the air carrier is owned and effectively controlled directly or through majority ownership by LACAC Member States and/or nationals of LACAC Member States, unless more favourable provisions have been agreed in the bilateral air services agreement between that Member State and Uruguay.</p>
        <p>5. A Member State may refuse, revoke, suspend or limit the authorisation or permissions of an air carrier designated by Uruguay where:</p>
        <p>(i) the air carrier is not established in Uruguay; or</p>
        <p>(ii) effective regulatory control of the air carrier is not exercised or not maintained by Uruguay or Uruguay is not responsible for issuing its Air Operators Certificate; or</p>
        <p>(iii) the air carrier is not owned and effectively controlled directly or through majority ownership by LACAC Member States and/or nationals of LACAC Member States, unless more favourable provisions have been agreed in the bilateral air services agreement between that Member State and Uruguay; or</p>
        <p>(iv) the air carrier is already authorised to operate under a bilateral agreement between the Member State and another LACAC Member State and the Member State demonstrates that, by exercising traffic rights under this Agreement on a route that includes a point in that other LACAC Member State, it would be circumventing restrictions on the traffic rights imposed by that other agreement.</p>
        <p>Article 3</p>
        <p>Rights with regard to regulatory control</p>
        <p>1. The provisions in paragraph 2 of this Article shall complement the Articles listed in Annex II(c).</p>
        <p>2. Where a Member State has designated an air carrier whose regulatory control is exercised and maintained by another Member State, the rights of Uruguay under the safety provisions of the agreement between the Member State that has designated the air carrier and Uruguay shall apply equally in respect of the adoption, exercise or maintenance of safety standards by that other Member State and in respect of the operating authorisations of that air carrier.</p>
        <p>Article 4</p>
        <p>Taxation of aviation fuel</p>
        <p>1. The provisions in paragraph 2 of this Article shall complement the corresponding provisions in the Articles listed in Annex II(d).</p>
        <p>2. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, nothing in each of the agreements listed in Annex II(d) shall prevent a Member State from imposing on a non-discriminatory basis taxes, levies, duties, fees or charges on fuel supplied in its territory for use in an aircraft of a designated air carrier of Uruguay that operates between a point in the territory of that Member State and another point in the territory of that Member State or in the territory of another Member State.</p>
        <p>3. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, nothing in each of the agreements listed in Annex II(d) shall prevent Uruguay from imposing on a non-discriminatory basis taxes, levies, duties, fees or charges on fuel supplied in its territory for use in an aircraft of a designated air carrier of a Member State that operates between a point in the territory of Uruguay and another point in the territory of Uruguay or in the territory of another LACAC Member State.</p>
        <p>Article 5</p>
        <p>Tariffs for carriage within the European Community</p>
        <p>1. The provisions in paragraph 2 of this Article shall complement the Articles listed in Annex II(e).</p>
        <p>2. The tariffs to be charged by the air carrier(s) designated by Uruguay under an agreement listed in Annex I containing a provision listed in Annex II(e) for carriage wholly within the European Community shall be subject to European Community law. European Community law is applied in a non-discriminatory manner.</p>
        <p>Article 6</p>
        <p>Compatibility with competition rules</p>
        <p>1. The bilateral air services agreements concluded between Member States and Uruguay shall not (i) require or favour the adoption of agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings or concerted practices that prevent, distort or restrict competition between air carriers on the relevant routes; or (ii) reinforce the effects of any such agreement, decision or concerted practice; or (iii) delegate to air carriers or other private economic operators the responsibility for taking measures that prevent, distort or restrict competition between air carriers on the relevant routes.</p>
        <p>2. The provisions listed in Annex II(f) shall not be applied in a way that would be incompatible with paragraph 1 of this Article.</p>
