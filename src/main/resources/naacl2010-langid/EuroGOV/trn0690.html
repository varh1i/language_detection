        <p>Commission Regulation (EC) No 1580/2002</p>
        <p>of 4 September 2002</p>
        <p>amending for the second time Council Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities associated with Usama bin Laden, the Al-Qaida network and the Taliban, and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 467/2001</p>
        <p>THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 of 27 May 2002 imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities associated with Usama bin Laden, the Al-Qaida network and the Taliban, and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 467/2001 prohibiting the export of certain goods and services to Afghanistan, strengthening the flight ban and extending the freezing of funds and other financial resources in respect of the Taliban of Afghanistan(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 951/2002(2), and in particular Article 7(1) thereof,</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 lists the persons, groups and entities covered by the freezing of funds and economic resources under that Regulation.</p>
        <p>(2) On 8 July, 26 August and 3 September 2002, the Sanctions Committee decided to amend the list of persons, groups and entities to whom the freezing of funds and economic resources shall apply and, therefore, Annex I should be amended accordingly.</p>
        <p>(3) Ummah Tameer E-Nau has been listed as a natural person in Regulation (EC) No 881/2002. However, the decision of the Sanctions Committee of 24 December 2001 on which this entry is based, and the consolidated list issued by the Sanctions Committee show that Ummah Tameer E-Nau is a legal person, group or entity. Since Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 purports to implement UN designations only, it is both necessary and appropriate to list Ummah Tameer E-Nau in the relevant section of the list.</p>
        <p>(4) In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, this Regulation must enter into force immediately,</p>
        <p>HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
        <p>Article 1</p>
        <p>1. The persons, groups and entities listed at Annex shall be added to the list at Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 881/2002.</p>
        <p>2. The following persons, groups and entities shall be removed from the list at Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 881/2002:</p>
