        <p>Directive 2003/52/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p>
        <p>of 18 June 2003</p>
        <p>amending Directive 95/2/EC as regards the conditions of use for a food additive E 425 konjac</p>
        <p>(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
        <p>THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
        <p>Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),</p>
        <p>Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) Directive 95/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 1995 on food additives other than colours and sweeteners(4) authorises the use of the food additive E 425 konjac in foodstuffs under certain conditions.</p>
        <p>(2) The Commission has taken measures to suspend temporarily the placing on the market of jelly mini-cups containing E 425 konjac because they have been found to be dangerous as they have caused the death of several children and elderly persons in third countries through choking.</p>
        <p>(3) Some manufacturers of jelly mini-cups recognise the risk to human health by affixing a warning on the food package, highlighting the risk for children and the elderly.</p>
        <p>(4) On the basis of the information provided by the Member States which adopted measures at national level, it can be concluded that jelly mini-cups containing E 425 konjac constitute a life-threatening risk. In addition to their shape and size, the chemical and physical properties of konjac are the cause for jelly mini-cups to constitute a serious risk to human health.</p>
        <p>(5) In the present case, warning through labelling is not sufficient to protect human health, especially with regard to children.</p>
        <p>(6) It is necessary to modify the conditions of use for E 425 konjac as regards its use in jelly confectionery, including jelly-mini cups.</p>
        <p>(7) Directive 95/2/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,</p>
        <p>HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p>
        <p>Article 1</p>
        <p>In Annex IV to Directive 95/2/EC in the row for E 425: Konjac: (i) Konjac gum (ii) Konjac glucomannane the text %quot%Foodstuffs in general (except those referred to in Article 2(3))%quot% shall be replaced by the text %quot%Foodstuffs in general (except those referred to in Article 2(3) and jelly confectionery including jelly-mini-cups)%quot%.</p>
        <p>Article 2</p>
        <p>Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 17 January 2004. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.</p>
        <p>When Member States adopt those measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.</p>
        <p>Article 3</p>
        <p>This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
        <p>Article 4</p>
        <p>This Directive is addressed to the Member States.</p>
