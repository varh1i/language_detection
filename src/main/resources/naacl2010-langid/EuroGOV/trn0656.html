        <p>THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>

        <p>(2) The Parties agreed in Protocol 2 to the Interim Agreement on steel products, to establish, immediately upon the entry into force of the said Agreement, a double-checking system, without quantitative limits, for the import into the Community of steel products originating in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
        <p>(3) Council Regulation (EC) No 190/98 of 19 January 1998 concerning the export of certain ECSC and EC steel products from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Community (double-checking system)(2) should be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation,</p>

        <p>2. The classification of the products covered by this Regulation is based on the tariff and statistical nomenclature of the Community (hereinafter called the %quot%Combined Nomenclature%quot%, or in abbreviated form %quot%CN%quot%). The origin of the products covered by this Regulation shall be determined in accordance with the rules in force in the Community.</p>
        <p>3. From the date of entry into force of the Interim Agreement and until further notice, imports into the Community of steel products originating in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as listed in Annex I shall also be subject to the issue of an export document by the competent authorities of the exporting country. The importer shall present the original of the export document not later than 31 March of the year following that in which the goods covered by the document were shipped.</p>
        <p>4. Shipment shall be considered to have taken place on the date of loading on to the exporting means of transport.</p>
        <p>5. The export document shall conform to the model shown in Annex II. It shall be valid for exports throughout the customs territory of the Community.</p>
        <p>Article 2</p>
        <p>1. The surveillance document referred to in Article 1(1) shall be issued automatically by the competent authority in the Member States, without charge, for any quantities requested, within five working days of presentation of an application by any Community importer, wherever established in the Community. This application shall be deemed to have been received by the competent national authority no later than three working days after submission, unless it is proven otherwise.</p>
        <p>2. A surveillance document issued by one of the competent national authorities listed in Annex III shall be valid throughout the Community.</p>

        <p>The importer shall also submit a copy of the contract of sale or purchase, the pro forma invoice and/or, in cases where the goods are not directly purchased in the country of production, a certificate of production issued by the producing steel mill.</p>
        <p>4. Surveillance documents may be used only for such time as arrangements for liberalisation of imports remain in force in respect of the transactions concerned. Without prejudice to possible changes in the import regulations in force or decisions taken in the framework of an agreement or the management of a quota:</p>
        <p>- the period of validity of the surveillance document is hereby fixed at four months,</p>
        <p>- unused or partly used surveillance documents may be renewed for an equal period.</p>

        <p>2. The Member States shall notify any anomalies or cases of fraud which they discover and, where relevant, the basis on which they have refused to grant a surveillance document.</p>
        <p>Article 5</p>
        <p>The notification provided for in this Regulation shall be given to the Commission of the European Communities (DG Trade E/2 and DG Enterprise E/2).</p>
        <p>Article 6</p>
        <p>Regulation (EC) No 190/98 is hereby repealed.</p>
        <p>Article 7</p>
