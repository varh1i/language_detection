      <head>Council Regulation (EC) No&amp;nbsp;1300/2005 of 3 August 2005 amending Regulation (EC) No&amp;nbsp;27/2005, as concerns herring, mackerel, horse mackerel, sole and vessels engaged in illegal fisheries</head>
      <div type="body">
        <p>Council Regulation (EC) No 1300/2005</p>
        <p>of 3 August 2005</p>
        <p>amending Regulation (EC) No 27/2005, as concerns herring, mackerel, horse mackerel, sole and vessels engaged in illegal fisheries</p>
        <p>THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy [1], and in particular Article 20 thereof,</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) Regulation (EC) No 27/2005 [2] fixes for 2005 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required.</p>
        <p>(2) The International Baltic Sea Fisheries Commission (IBSFC) adopted a recommendation in September 2004 to increase the fishing opportunities for herring by 10000 tonnes for 2004 in Management Unit 3, which would give Finland an additional 8199 tonnes of fishing opportunities for herring. This recommendation was not made part of the Community legislation. As a consequence Finland has overfished its quota by 7856 tonnes for 2004 as the additional tonnes were not allocated. In Commission Regulation (EC) No 776/2005 of 19 May 2005 adapting certain fish quotas for 2005 pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas [3] the Finnish quota of herring for 2005 was reduced by 7856 tonnes due to the overfishing. The Finnish quota for herring in subdivision 30-31 should therefore be increased by 7856 tonnes as the reduction was due to the fact that the IBSFC recommendation was not implemented in Community legislation. This amendment will not increase the amount of herring caught by Finland in 2005.</p>
        <p>(3) The total available catch (TAC) adopted for mackerel in management area IIa (non-EC waters), Vb (EC waters), VI, VII, VIIIa, b, d, e, XII, XIV should cover EC waters and international waters of Vb in order to avoid misreporting. The management area should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
        <p>(4) The TAC adopted for horse mackerel in management area Vb (EC waters), VI, VII, VIIIa, b, d, e, XII, XIV should cover EC waters and international waters of Vb in order to avoid misreporting. The management area should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
        <p>(5) In the light of new scientific advice the TAC for common sole can be increased to 900 tonnes in management area IIIa, IIIb, c, d (EC waters). The TAC should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
        <p>(6) In order to allowing weighing of herring, mackerel and horse mackerel after transport from the port of landing, complementary measures should be implemented in 2005.</p>
        <p>(7) In accordance with the Agreed Record of Conclusions of Fisheries Consultations between the European Community and Norway for 2005 the Parties have access to fish 50000 tonnes of their respective North Sea herring quotas in the other Parties' waters of Divisions IVa and IVb. These quantities can be increased by 10000 tonnes if called for. By letter of 29 June 2005 Norway has called for such an increase. The Community has submitted a similar request on 20 July 2005. It is therefore appropriate to implement these changes in the Community legislation.</p>
        <p>(8) In May 2005 the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) made a recommendation to place a number of vessels on the list of vessels that have been confirmed as having engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fisheries. A recommendation on measures to be applied on such vessels was adopted in February 2004. Implementation of the recommendations in the Community legal order should be ensured.</p>
        <p>(9) Given the urgency of the matter, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period referred to in paragraph I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities.</p>
        <p>(10) Regulation (EC) No 27/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly,</p>
        <p>HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
        <p>Article 1</p>
        <p>Annexes IA, IB and III to Regulation (EC) No 27/2005 are hereby amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.</p>
        <p>Article 2</p>
        <p>This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
        <p>This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>

By way of derogation from point 9.6.1, Member States may permit fresh fish to be weighed after transport from the port of landing provided that the fish is transported to a destination on the territory of the Member State no more than 60 kilometres from the port of landing and that:</p>
        <p>(a) the tanker in which the fish is transported is accompanied by an inspector from the place of landing to the place where the fish is weighed; or</p>
        <p>(b) approval is given by the competent authorities at the place of landing to transport the fish subject to the following provisions:</p>
        <p>(i) immediately prior to the tanker leaving the port of landing, the buyer or his agent shall provide to the competent authorities a written declaration giving the species of the fish and name of the vessel from which it is to be discharged, the unique identity number of the tanker and details of the destination where the fish will be weighed as well as the estimated time of arrival of the tanker at the destination,</p>
        <p>(ii) a copy of the declaration provided for in (i) shall be kept by the driver during the transport of the fish and handed over to the receiver of the fish at the destination.</p>
        <p>9.8. Invoice</p>
        <p>9.8.1. In addition to the obligations set out in Article 9(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 2847/93 the processor or buyer of the quantities of fresh fish landed shall submit to the competent authorities of the Member State concerned a copy of the invoice or a document replacing it, as referred to in Article 22(3) of the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes — Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment [9].</p>
        <p>9.8.2. Any such invoice or document shall include the information required by Article 9(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2847/93 as well as the name and registration number of the vessel from which the fish has been landed. This invoice or document shall be submitted on demand or within 12 hours of the completion on the weighing.</p>
        <p>9.9. Weighing of frozen fish</p>
        <p>9.9.1. All buyers or holders of frozen fish shall ensure that the quantities landed are weighed prior to the fish being processed, held in storage, transported from the port of landing or resold. Any tare weight equal to the weight of boxes, plastic or other containers in which the fish to be weighed is packed may be deducted from the weight of any quantities landed.</p>
        <p>9.9.2. Alternatively, the weight of frozen fish packed in boxes may be determined by multiplying the average weight of a representative sample based on weighing the contents removed from the box and without plastic packaging whether or not after the thawing of any ice on the surface of the fish. Member States shall notify to the Commission for approval any changes in their sampling methodology approved by the Commission during 2004. Changes shall be approved by the Commission. The figure resulting from the weighing shall be used for the completion of landing declarations and sales notes.</p>
        <p>9.10. Weighing facilities</p>
        <p>9.10.1. In cases where publicly operated weighing facilities are used the party weighing the fish shall issue to the buyer a weighing slip indicating the date and time of the weighing and the identity number of the tanker. A copy of the weighing slip shall be attached to the invoice submitted to the competent authorities as provided for in point 9.8.</p>
        <p>9.10.2. In cases where privately operated weighing facilities are used the system shall be approved, calibrated and sealed by the competent authorities and be subject to the following provisions:</p>
        <p>(a) the party weighing the fish shall keep a paginated weighing logbook indicating:</p>
        <p>(i) the name and registration number of the vessel from which the fish has been landed,</p>
        <p>(ii) the identity number of the tankers in cases where fish has been transported from the port of landing before weighing,</p>
        <p>(iii) the species of fish,</p>
        <p>(iv) the weight of each landing,</p>
        <p>(v) the date and time of the beginning and end of the weighing;</p>
        <p>(b) where the weighing is carried out on a conveyor belt system a visible counter shall be fitted that records the cumulative total of the weight. Such cumulative total shall be recorded in the paginated logbook referred to in point (a);</p>
        <p>(c) the weighing logbook and the copies of written declarations provided for in point 9.7.1(b)(ii) shall be kept for three years.</p>
        <p>9.11. Access by competent authorities</p>
        <p>The competent authorities shall have full access at all times to the weighing system, the weighing logbooks, written declarations and all premises where the fish is processed and kept.</p>
        <p>9.12. Cross-checks</p>
