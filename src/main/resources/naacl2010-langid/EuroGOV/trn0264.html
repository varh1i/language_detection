        <p>Commission Decision</p>
        <p>of 4 April 2006</p>
        <p>amending Decision 2004/450/EC as regards the standard requirements for the content of applications for Community financing for programmes for the eradication, monitoring and control of TSEs</p>

        <p>THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field [1], and in particular Article 24(11) thereof,</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) Decision 90/424/EEC lays down the procedures governing the Communityâ€™s financial contribution towards programmes for the eradication and monitoring of certain animal diseases listed in that Decision.</p>
        <p>(2) Commission Decision 2004/450/EC of 29 April 2004 laying down standard requirements for the content of applications for Community financing for programmes for the eradication, monitoring and control of animal diseases [2] sets out the information to be contained in the applications to be submitted by the Member States to the Commission.</p>
        <p>(3) Annex III to Decision 2004/450/EC lays down the standard requirements for the submission of programmes of eradication and monitoring of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) co-financed by the Community. That Annex refers to certain provisions of Annexes III and VII to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies [3].</p>
        <p>(4) Annexes III and VII to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 have been amended by Commission Regulations (EC) No 1492/2004 [4], (EC) No 36/2005 [5] and (EC) No 214/2005 [6]. Therefore it is appropriate to amend Decision 2004/450/EC in order to take account of the amendments to Annexes III and VII to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001.</p>
        <p>(5) Decision 2004/450/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
        <p>(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>
        <p>HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
        <p>Article 1</p>
        <p>Annex III to Decision 2004/450/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.</p>
        <p>Article 2</p>
        <p>This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
