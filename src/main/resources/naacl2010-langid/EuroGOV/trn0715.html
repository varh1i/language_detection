        <p>Commission Decision</p>
        <p>of 20 January 2006</p>
        <p>amending Decision 2005/710/EC concerning certain protection measures in relation to a suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Romania</p>
        <p>(notified under document number C(2006) 61)</p>
        <p>(Text with EEA relevance)</p>
        <p>(2006/23/EC)</p>
        <p>THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC [1], and in particular Article 18(7) thereof,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries [2], and in particular Article 22(6) thereof,</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and other birds, causing mortality and disturbance which can quickly take on epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to reduce the profitability of poultry farming sharply. There is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced via international trade in live poultry and poultry products.</p>
        <p>(2) On 12 October 2005 Romania notified the Commission of the isolation of an influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 Asian strain collected from a clinical case in poultry. Commission Decision 2005/710/EC of 13 October 2005 concerning certain protection measures in relation to a suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Romania [3] was therefore adopted.</p>
        <p>(3) Romania has applied strict disease control measures and has sent further information on the disease situation to the Commission which justify limiting the suspension of imports to those parts of the territory of Romania that are affected and at risk.</p>
        <p>(4) Decision 2005/710/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.</p>
        <p>(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>
        <p>HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
        <p>Article 1</p>
        <p>Decision 2005/710/EC is amended as follows:</p>

        <p>4.
