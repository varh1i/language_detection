        <p>Final Report of the Hearing Officer in Case COMP/C-3/37.980 — Souris/Topps</p>
        <p>(pursuant to Article 15 of Commission Decision (2001/462/EC, ECSC) of 23 May 2001 on the terms of reference of Hearing Officers in certain competition proceedings — OJ L 162, 19.6.2001, p. 21)</p>
        <p>(2006/C 303/05)</p>
        <p>The draft decision in this case gives rise to the following observations:</p>
        <p>The case was initiated following a complaint by S.A.R.L La Souris Bleue on 3 October 2000.</p>
        <p>On 16 June 2003 the Commission addressed the Statement of Objections to The Topps Company Inc (%quot%Topps USA%quot%), Topps Europe Limited, Topps International Limited, Topps UK Limited, and Topps Italia SRL.</p>
        <p>The addressees were given two months to reply to the Statement of Objections.</p>
        <p>On 25 June and 24 July 2003 I received requests from the legal representatives of all the companies concerned for an extension of the deadline. They have been granted an extension of one month.</p>
        <p>The European subsidiaries were given access to the file on 3 July 2003. Topps USA was given access to the file on 13 August 2003.</p>
        <p>All addressees replied on 18 September 2003 and requested an oral hearing pursuant to Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2842/98, which took place on 23 October 2003.</p>
        <p>The complainant did not request to participate to the oral hearing.</p>
        <p>In the light of the above, I consider that the rights to be heard have been respected in the present case. The draft decision deals only with objections in respect of which the parties have been afforded the opportunity of making known their views.</p>
