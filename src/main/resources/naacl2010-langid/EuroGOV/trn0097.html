      <div type="body">
        <p>Action brought on 23 January 2006 — Deutsche Telekom v OHIM</p>
        <p>Parties</p>
        <p>Applicant: Deutsche Telekom AG (Bonn, Germany) (represented by J.-C. Gaedertz, lawyer)</p>
        <p>Defendant: Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs)</p>
        <p>Form of order sought</p>
        <p>The applicant claims that the Court should:</p>
        <p>- annul the decision of the Second Board of Appeal of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market of 17 November 2005;</p>
        <p>- order the defendant to pay the costs of the proceedings.</p>
        <p>Pleas in law and main arguments</p>
        <p>Community trade mark concerned: The word mark %quot%Alles, was uns verbindet%quot% for goods and services in Classes 9, 16, 35, 36, 38 and 42 — Application No 3648441</p>
        <p>Decision of the Examiner: Refusal of the application</p>
        <p>Decision of the Board of Appeal: Dismissal of the appeal</p>
        <p>Pleas in law: Infringement of Article 7(1)(b) and (c) of Council Regulation No 40/94, since the mark applied for is distinctive in respect of the designated goods and services and is not of a descriptive nature, because the combination of words is unusual and uncommon in relation to the goods and services claimed.</p>
