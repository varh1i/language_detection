        <p>Council Common Position 2004/852/CFSP</p>
        <p>of 13 December 2004</p>
        <p>concerning restrictive measures against Côte d'Ivoire</p>
        <p>THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 15 thereof,</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) On 15 November 2004 the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1572 (2004), hereinafter referred to as "UNSCR 1572 (2004)", prohibiting the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer to Côte d'Ivoire, from Member States' territories or by their nationals, or using their flag vessels or aircraft, of arms or any related materiel, in particular military aircraft and equipment, whether or not originating in their territories, as well as the provision of any assistance, advice or training related to military activities.</p>
        <p>(2) In order to implement these measures, financing or financial assistance related to military activities should also be prohibited.</p>
        <p>(3) UNSCR 1572 (2004) also imposes measures to prevent the entry into or transit through Member States' territories of all persons designated by the Committee established by paragraph 14 of that Resolution ("the Committee"), who constitute a threat to the peace and national reconciliation process in Côte d'Ivoire, in particular those who block the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis and Accra III Agreements, and any other person determined as responsible for serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Côte d'Ivoire on the basis of relevant information, any other person who incites publicly hatred and violence and any other person determined by the Committee to be in violation of measures imposed under the arms embargo.</p>
        <p>(4) UNSCR 1572 (2004) furthermore imposes a freeze of funds, other financial assets and economic resources, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the persons designated by the Committee or held by entities owned or controlled directly or indirectly by any persons acting on their behalf or at their direction, as designated by the Committee, and that no funds, financial assets or economic resources are made available to or for the benefit of such persons or entities.</p>
        <p>(5) Paragraph 19 of UNSCR 1572 (2004) provides that the measures relating to the entry into or transit through Member States' territories and to the freezing of funds, financial assets and economic resources shall enter into force on 15 December 2004, unless the Security Council shall determine before then that the signatories of the Linas-Marcoussis and Accra III Agreements have implemented all their commitments under the Accra III Agreement and are embarked towards full implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement.</p>
        <p>(6) On 22 November 2004, the Council stated that in order to further contribute to peace in Côte d'Ivoire and to prevent destabilisation of the subregion, the EU will continue to support initiatives taken by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union (AU).</p>
        <p>(7) The Council also reaffirmed the EU's strong commitment to supporting the implementation of the Linas-Marcoussis and Accra Agreements by all appropriate means.</p>
        <p>(8) Action by the Community is needed in order to implement certain measures,</p>

        <p>4. Paragraph 2 shall not apply to the addition to frozen accounts of:</p>
        <p>(a) interest or other earnings on those accounts; or</p>
