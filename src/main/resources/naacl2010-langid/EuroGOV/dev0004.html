        <p>Aid No : XF 12/06</p>
        <p>Explanatory remarks : As part of the transitional process which the Netherlands has set in motion for the North Sea cutter fleet, the Minister for Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality has decided to launch a number of pilot projects on "more careful fishing". During these projects, fishermen will perform scientifically-assisted experiments relating to fishing methods that are more energy-efficient, sustainable and selective. No subsidy is planned during this pilot project for investments in equipment such as nets, gear or engines, or investments directly related to a vessel's fishing activities. The subsidy granted by the authority consists of a guaranteed amount to the masters/owners taking part in a pilot project</p>
        <p>Member State : The Netherlands</p>
        <p>Title of aid scheme or name of company receiving individual aid : The aid will be awarded to the Federation of Fishery Associations, the principal body implementing the pilot project "more careful fishing/outrigging"</p>
        <p>Legal basis : Artikel 2 en 5 van de Kaderwet LNV-subsidies juncto artikel 4:23 van de Algemene wet bestuursrecht</p>
        <p>Annual expenditure planned or overall amount of aid granted to the company : One-off payment of EUR 150000, one-fifth of which is earmarked for the technical/scientific support</p>
        <p>Maximum aid intensity : The maximum amount of aid for the groups implementing the pilot project plus the costs for the scientific support is EUR 150000, with a maximum of EUR 30000 for the scientific support</p>
        <p>Date of implementation : As from 14 August 2006</p>
        <p>Duration of scheme or individual aid award : The pilot project will run until the end of October 2006. Payment is expected to take place in November-December 2006</p>
        <p>Objective of aid :</p>
        <p>The activities to be conducted by the fishing companies as part of the pilot project "more careful fishing/adaptation of fishing gear" are intended to provide experience with methods of fishing which have not been used hitherto by Dutch fishermen. These involve experiments which consistute an alternative to traditional trawling operations and could be introduced more widely within the industry. The investment risks for companies have until now been reason enough for them not to invest in new fishing methods. Now that the government wishes to act as guarantor to support the fishermen who will carry out the tests as part of the transitional process for the North Sea cutter fleet to fishing methods that are more energy-efficient, sustainable and selective, the fishermen concerned are prepared to carry out the project. In this pilot project, a group of five fishermen who are members of the Federation of Fishery Assocations will for a limited period of time (August to October 2002 inclusive) experiment with a floating vessel which operates off the seabed. This should have a direct positive impact on catches of immature fish and fish quality. Other circular trawlheads and adapted beam designs to produce lower resistance as well as less contact with the seabed will also be tried out.</p>
        <p>The pilot project should provide information about how to cut costs, lower the number of discards, and reduce contact with the seabed</p>
        <p>Relevant Articles of Regulation No 1595/2004 : The guarantee to the participants in the pilot project is based on Article 4 of Regulation 1595/2004, which refers to Article 15 of the FIFG. The latter Article states that Member States may encourage operations of collective interest with a broader scope than operations normally undertaken by private businesses. The FIFG states that these activities may be carried out with the active contribution of members of the trade themselves or by organisations acting on behalf of the producers and serving to attain the objectives of the CFP</p>

        <p>Explanatory remarks : As part of the transitional process which the Netherlands has set in motion for the North Sea cutter fleet, the Minister for Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality has decided to launch a number of pilot projects on 'more careful fishing'. During these projects, fishermen will, for a maximumof three months, perform scientifically-assisted experiments relating to fishing methods that are more energy-efficient, sustainable and selective.

In this pilot project, a group of four fishermen who are members of the Dutch Fishermen's Federation will for a limited period of time (August to October 2002 inclusive) experiment with outrigging, which is a new method of fishing for the Netherlands. This method of fishing is an alternative to beam trawling. Fishing is carried out using so-called "Perfect" kites but, unlike with regular kite or twin rig fishing, the net is directly attached to the seabed. In addition to cutting costs, reducing the number of discards is an important subcomponent of this pilot project</p>
