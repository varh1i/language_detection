        <p>Commission Decision</p>
        <p>of 30 May 2002</p>
        <p>concerning the technical specification for interoperability relating to the operation subsystem of the trans-European high-speed rail system referred to in Article 6(1) of Council Directive 96/48/EC</p>
        <p>(notified under document number C(2002) 1951)</p>

        <p>THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Directive 96/48/EC of 23 July 1996 on the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail network(1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) In accordance with Article 2(c) of Directive 96/48/EC, the trans-European high-speed rail system is subdivided into structural or functional subsystems. These subsystems are described in Annex II to the Directive.</p>
        <p>(2) In accordance with Article 5(1) of the Directive, each of the subsystems shall be covered by a technical specification for interoperability (TSI).</p>
        <p>(3) In accordance with Article 6(1) of the Directive, draft TSIs shall be drawn up by the joint representative body.</p>
        <p>(4) The Committee set up pursuant to Article 21 of Directive 96/48/EC has appointed the European Association for Railway Interoperability (AEIF) as the joint representative body in accordance with Article 2(h) of the Directive.</p>
        <p>(5) The AEIF has been given a mandate to draw up a draft TSI for the operation subsystem in accordance with Article 6(1) of the Directive. This mandate was established in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21(2) of the Directive.</p>
        <p>(6) The AEIF has drawn up the draft TSI, together with an introductory report containing a cost-benefit analysis as provided for in Article 6(3) of the Directive.</p>
        <p>(7) The draft TSI has been examined by the representatives of the Member States, in the framework of the Committee set up by the Directive, in the light of the introductory report.</p>
        <p>(8) The TSI, which is the subject of this Decision, does not impose the use of specific technologies or technical solutions except where this is strictly necessary for the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail network.</p>
        <p>(9) The TSI, which is the subject of this Decision, is based on best available expert knowledge at the time of preparation of the corresponding draft. Developments in technology or social requirements may make it necessary to amend or supplement this TSI. Where appropriate, a review or updating procedure will be initiated in accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 96/48/EC.</p>
        <p>(10) In some cases, the TSI, which is the subject of this Decision, allows a choice between different solutions, making it possible to apply definitive or transitional interoperable solutions that are compatible with the existing situation. In addition, Directive 96/48/EC provides for special implementing provisions in certain specific cases. Furthermore, in the cases provided for in Article 7 of the Directive, Member States must be allowed not to apply certain technical specifications. It is therefore necessary that the Member States ensure that an infrastructure register and a rolling stock register are published and updated each year. These registers will set out the main characteristics of the national infrastructure and rolling stock (e.g. the basic parameters) and their concordance with the characteristics prescribed by the applicable TSIs. To this end, the TSI, which is the subject of this Decision, indicates precisely which information must appear in the registers.</p>
        <p>(11) The application of the TSI which is the subject of this Decision must take into account specific criteria relating to technical and operational compatibility between the infrastructures and the rolling stock to be placed in service and the network into which they are to be integrated. These compatibility requirements entail a complex technical and economical analysis that is to be done on a case-by-case basis. The analysis should take into account:</p>
        <p>- the interfaces between the different subsystems referred to in Directive 96/48/EC,</p>
        <p>- the different categories of lines and rolling stock referred to in that Directive, and</p>
        <p>- the technical and operational environments of the existing network.</p>
        <p>(12) The provisions of this Decision are in conformity with the opinion of the Committee set up by Directive 96/48/EC.</p>
        <p>HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
        <p>Article 1</p>
        <p>The TSI relating to the %quot%operation%quot% subsystem of the trans-European high-speed rail system referred to in Article 6(1) of Directive 96/48/EC is hereby adopted by the Commission. The TSI is set out in the Annex to this Decision. The TSI is fully applicable to the infrastructure and rolling stock of the trans-European high-speed rail system as defined in Annex I to Directive 96/48/EC, taking into account the conditions set out in Chapter 7 of the attached TSI.</p>
        <p>Article 2</p>
        <p>The attached TSI shall enter into force six months after notification of this Decision.</p>
        <p>Article 3</p>
        <p>This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>

        <p>ANNEX</p>
        <p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION FOR INTEROPERABILITY RELATING TO THE OPERATION SUBSYSTEM</p>
        <p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
        <p>1.1. TECHNICAL SCOPE</p>
        <p>This TSI concerns the %quot%operation%quot% subsystem, which is one of the subsystems listed in Annex II(1) to Directive 96/48/EC.</p>
        <p>This TSI is part of a set of six TSIs, which cover all the eight subsystems defined in the Directive. The specifications concerning the %quot%users%quot% and %quot%environment%quot% subsystems, which are necessary to ensure interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system in compliance with the essential requirements, are set out in the TSIs concerned.</p>
        <p>More information about the operation subsystem is given in Chapter 2.</p>
        <p>1.2. GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE</p>
        <p>The geographical scope of this TSI is the trans-European high-speed rail system as described in Annex I to Directive 96/48/EC.</p>
        <p>Reference shall be made in particular to the lines of the trans-European rail network described in Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network or in any update to the same Decision as a result of the revision provided for in Article 21 of that Decision.</p>
        <p>1.3. CONTENT OF THIS TSI</p>
        <p>In accordance with Article 5(3) of and with Annex I(1)(b) to Directive 96/48/EC, this TSI:</p>
        <p>(a) specifies the essential requirements for the %quot%operation%quot% subsystem and its interfaces (Chapter 3);</p>
        <p>(b) establishes the basic parameters described in Annex II(3) to that Directive, which are necessary to meet the essential requirements (Chapter 4);</p>
        <p>(c) establishes the conditions to be complied with to achieve the specified performances for each of the following categories of line (Chapter 4):</p>
        <p>- category I: specially built high-speed lines equipped for speeds generally equal to or greater than 250 km/h,</p>
        <p>- category II: specially upgraded high-speed lines equipped for speeds of the order of 200 km/h,</p>
        <p>- category III: specially upgraded high-speed lines which have special features as a result of topographical, relief or town-planning constraints, on which the speed must be adapted to each case.</p>
        <p>(d) establishes implementing provisions in certain specific cases (Chapter 7);</p>
        <p>(e) determines the interoperability constituents and interfaces which must be covered by European specifications, including European standards, which are needed in order to achieve interoperability within the trans-European high-speed rail system while meeting the essential requirements (Chapter 5);</p>
        <p>(f) states, in each case under consideration, which of the modules defined in Decision 93/465/EEC or, where appropriate, which specific procedures are to be used in order to assess either the conformity or the suitability for use of the interoperability constituents, as well as %quot%EC%quot% verification of the subsystems (Chapter 6).</p>
        <p>2. SUBSYSTEM DEFINITION AND SCOPE OF APPLICATION</p>
        <p>The operation subsystem of the trans-European high-speed rail system comprises all the elements which allow the overall implementation and functionality of the system within the scope of railway operations, once the technical and functional elements of the other subsystems have been defined.</p>
        <p>The operation of a railway system is governed by rules and regulations drawn up by the infrastructure managers that must also be implemented by the railway undertakings.</p>
        <p>The initial start up of operation on a railway network requires qualified staff who apply the procedures defined in a manner consistent with the overall safety system of the network.</p>
        <p>The following main functions relating to operating safety should be distinguished for operational implementation of the system:</p>
        <p>- train driving,</p>
        <p>- on-board staff,</p>
        <p>- ground-based traffic management.</p>
        <p>Besides these, there are organisations that handle the design and updating of the processes, the procedures and the necessary documentation.</p>
        <p>For each of the above functions, personnel involved shall be identified and listed in the necessary documents.</p>
        <p>The procedures shall be published in a regulatory document.</p>
        <p>To achieve interoperability, the stated documentation shall be adapted to address the sole needs of interoperability, taking into account the human factors essential for dependable and efficient application of procedures.</p>
        <p>The ideal solution would be to standardise or harmonise the operating rules of all the railways on the relevant routes.</p>
        <p>However, even if this difficult ideal were achieved, it might actually defeat the overall %quot%safety coherence%quot% of a network and thereby impede the safe running of other trains on the same routes, which would be contrary to the Directive.</p>
        <p>Consequently, the requirement set out in essential requirement 2.7.1 of the Directive to align the network operating rules can apply only to harmonisation of the structure of the documents so that the driver, for instance, can follow the specific rules of each infrastructure manager along the route safely and effectively.</p>
        <p>Conversely, any procedures directly relating to the operation of a new, common system implemented on the interoperable network must be standardised.</p>
        <p>As far as qualification of the staff involved and in particular drivers, such qualification contributes substantially to maintaining a high level of safety and must therefore be organised in a uniform way in order to achieve the same level of safety on all the infrastructure networks which may be operated on.</p>
        <p>Moreover, when carrying out these procedures, it is necessary for all the different members of staff to understand one another without any hesitation whatsoever, even in emergency situations; which makes it necessary to define the rules to be complied with in matters of communication and, in particular, the use of languages.</p>
        <p>Operating safety also requires consistent checking of the system, through verifications and feedback of experience from the field.</p>
        <p>The scope of application may be defined as the use of one or more routes as specified in the train service provided, by a designated set of rolling stock and specified members of staff.</p>
        <p>The aspects of the operation subsystem which relate to the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system may all be grouped under one of the following headings:</p>
        <p>- procedures,</p>
        <p>- documentation,</p>
        <p>- qualification of personnel,</p>
        <p>- communications,</p>
        <p>- system monitoring.</p>
        <p>%quot%Infrastructure manager%quot% means the body referred to in Article 3 and Article 7 of Directive 91/440/EEC and in Article 1 of Directive 2001/12/EC. The reallocation of tasks to bodies different from infrastructure managers is possible under Directive 2001/12/EC and the information concerning this reallocation must be mentioned in the network statement to be published by infrastructure managers in accordance with Directive 2001/14/EC.</p>
        <p>3. ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
        <p>3.1. COMPLIANCE WITH THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
        <p>According to Article 4(1) of Directive 96/48/EC, the trans-European high-speed rail system, subsystems and their interoperability constituents must meet the essential requirements set out in general terms in Annex III to the Directive.</p>
        <p>3.2. ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS ASPECTS</p>
        <p>The essential requirements cover:</p>
        <p>- safety,</p>
        <p>- reliability and availability,</p>
        <p>- health,</p>
        <p>- environmental protection,</p>
        <p>- technical compatibility.</p>
        <p>According to Directive 96/48/EC, the essential requirements may be generally applicable to the whole trans-European high-speed rail system or be specific to each subsystem and its constituents.</p>
        <p>3.3. ASPECTS RELATING SPECIFICALLY TO THE OPERATION SUBSYSTEM</p>
        <p>In the case of the operation subsystem, the specific aspects, in addition to the considerations in Annex III to the Directive, are as follows.</p>
        <p>3.3.1. SAFETY</p>
        <p>In accordance with Annex III to Directive 96/48/EC, the safety-related essential requirements that apply to the operation subsystem are the following:</p>
        <p>Essential requirement 1.1.1:</p>
        <p>%quot%The design, construction or assembly, maintenance and monitoring of safety-critical components, and more particularly of the components involved in train movements must be such as to guarantee safety at the level corresponding to the aims laid down for the network, including those for specific degraded situations.%quot%</p>
        <p>This essential requirement is not relevant to the operation subsystem.</p>
        <p>Essential requirement 1.1.2:</p>
        <p>%quot%The parameters involved in the wheel/rail contact must meet the stability requirements needed in order to guarantee safe movement at the maximum authorised speed.%quot%</p>

        <p>4. CHARACTERISATION OF THE OPERATION SUBSYSTEM</p>
        <p>The trans-European high-speed rail system to which Directive 96/48/EC applies and of which the operation subsystem is a part, is an integrated system whose coherence must be verified in particular with the basic parameters, the interfaces and performance, for the purpose of ensuring interoperability of the system in compliance with the essential requirements.</p>
        <p>The basic parameters and applicable specifications for each interoperability element, characterising the operation subsystem, are shown below.</p>
        <p>4.1. PARAMETERS OF THE OPERATION SUBSYSTEM</p>
        <p>None of the %quot%basic parameters%quot% listed in Annex II to Directive 96/48/EC is relevant to the operation subsystem.</p>

        <p>In the case of the operation subsystem, certain other parameters as specified below must be met for operating interoperable high-speed trains, but they are not all specifically relevant to high-speed.</p>
        <p>In the absence of a definition of the needs for all trains, at least the following safety-critical elements shall be specified.</p>
        <p>4.1.1. PROCEDURES FOR OPERATING A NEW SYSTEM</p>
        <p>The procedures to be used for identical situations linked directly to the operation of a new system intended to be used on the interoperable European network must be unique; for ERTMS/ETCS in particular, they shall comply with a European specification which shall be established.</p>
        <p>4.1.2. DOCUMENTATION</p>
        <p>4.1.2.1. Driver's documentation</p>
        <p>4.1.2.1.1. Procedures</p>
        <p>All the necessary procedures for the driver shall be included in a document or a computer medium called the driver's rule book.</p>
        <p>The driver's rule book shall state the requirements for the routes worked and the rolling stock used on those routes according to the situations of normal operation and degraded operation which the driver may meet.</p>
        <p>Every driver's rule book shall be drafted following the standardised outline or format below:</p>
        <p>A - Organisation of the service</p>

        <p>C - Signalling and command and control</p>
        <p>D - Running conditions of the rolling stock</p>
        <p>E - Onboard systems</p>
        <p>F - Running and driving of the train</p>
        <p>G - Anomalies, incidents and accidents</p>
        <p>Appendix 1 to driver's rule book: Manual of communication procedures</p>
        <p>Appendix 2 to driver's rule book: Book of forms (%quot%Livret formulaires%quot%).</p>
        <p>The driver's rule book shall be written in the language of one of the States of the interoperable network chosen by the railway undertaking in liaison with the infrastructure managers of the networks that the service will be operated on, except for messages and forms (%quot%formulaires%quot%) which shall remain in the language of the infrastructure managers (see subsection 4.1.4.1).</p>

        <p>- to enable the infrastructure manager to draw up the messages and books of forms (formulaires). These elements shall, be addressed to the railway undertakings at the same time as the delimited rules and regulations are made available,</p>
        <p>- for the infrastructure managers and the railway undertaking to draw up the documents for the operators (books of forms: livret formulaires), instructions for the personnel responsible for traffic management and Appendix 1 to the driver's rule book %quot%Manual of communication procedures%quot%.</p>
        <p>1. NATURE AND STRUCTURE OF THE SAFETY-RELATED MESSAGES</p>
        <p>1.1. NATURE</p>
        <p>The safety-related messages shall be defined in a formal manner by each infrastructure manager according to four types:</p>
        <p>- top priority emergency messages,</p>
        <p>- procedural messages,</p>
        <p>- additional messages,</p>
        <p>- information messages with a variable content.</p>
        <p>The rules concerning the transmission of these messages are given under section 2 - %quot%Communication methodology%quot%.</p>
        <p>1.1.1. Top priority emergency messages</p>
        <p>The top priority emergency safety messages are intended to give urgent operational instructions.</p>
        <p>To avoid any risk of misunderstanding, the message is always repeated.</p>
        <p>Classified according to need, the main messages which can be sent are indicated hereafter: in addition, other top priority emergency messages may, if necessary, be defined by the infrastructure manager.</p>
        <p>The top priority emergency messages may be followed by procedural messages (see subsection 1.1.2).</p>
        <p>All essential top priority emergency messages are indicated in Appendix 1 %quot%Manual of communications procedures%quot% to the rule book for drivers and in the documents of instructions for use by the personnel responsible for traffic management.</p>
        <p>1.1.1.1. Messages sent either by the ground or the driver</p>
        <p>- Need to stop all trains:</p>
        <p>%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2002245EN.039301.TIF%quot%%gt%</p>
        <p>Information on location or area are, if necessary, specified in the message.</p>
        <p>In addition, this message is to be quickly complemented, if possible, by the reason, the location of the emergency and the train's identification:</p>
        <p>%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2002245EN.039302.TIF%quot%%gt%</p>
        <p>- Need to stop a particular train:</p>
        <p>%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2002245EN.039303.TIF%quot%%gt%</p>
        <p>- Need for radio silence:</p>
        <p>%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2002245EN.039304.TIF%quot%%gt%</p>
        <p>1.1.1.2. Messages issued by the driver</p>
        <p>- Need to cut the traction power supply:</p>
        <p>%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2002245EN.039305.TIF%quot%%gt%</p>
        <p>This message is to be quickly complemented, if possible, by the reason, the location of the emergency and the train's identification:</p>
        <p>%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2002245EN.039306.TIF%quot%%gt%</p>
        <p>1.1.2. Procedure messages</p>
        <p>1.1.2.1. Nature of the messages</p>
        <p>Procedural messages are used to send operational instructions associated with situations represented in the driver's rule book.</p>
        <p>They comprise the text of the message itself, corresponding to a situation, and a number identifying the message.</p>
        <p>If the message requires the recipient to report back, the text of the report is also given.</p>
        <p>These messages use predetermined wording prescribed by the infrastructure managers in their own language and they are presented in the form of pre-printed paper forms.</p>
        <p>1.1.2.2. Procedure forms</p>
        <p>Procedure Forms are the formalised medium for procedural messages.</p>
        <p>Their purpose is to:</p>
        <p>- provide a common working document used in real-time by the ground staff responsible for traffic management and by the drivers,</p>
        <p>- enable traceability of communications.</p>
        <p>These forms are identified by a unique code word or number relating to the procedure.</p>
        <p>They are drawn up by each infrastructure manager in his own language.</p>
        <p>1.1.2.3. Book of forms (livret formulaires)</p>
        <p>The whole set of forms must be collected into books (books of forms) in paper form:</p>
        <p>- a book of forms intended for the driver which groups all the forms that might be used by the different infrastructure managers anywhere on the route travelled. The book of forms shall constitute Appendix 2 to the driver's rule book,</p>
        <p>- a book of forms intended for personnel responsible for traffic management, allowing them to put into practice all the procedures used within their territory.</p>
        <p>The book of forms are in two parts.</p>
        <p>The first part comprises the following items.</p>
        <p>- a reminder about the utilisation of the book of forms,</p>
        <p>- an index of ground-originated procedure forms,</p>
        <p>- an index of driver-originated procedure forms,</p>
        <p>- the list of situations cross-referencing to which procedure form is to be used,</p>
        <p>- a glossary giving the situations to which each procedure form applies,</p>
        <p>- the code for spelling out messages (phonetic alphabet etc.).</p>
        <p>The second part contains the procedure forms themselves.</p>
        <p>Several model forms are included in the book of forms and page dividers shall be used.</p>
        <p>The railway undertaking may include explanatory text relevant to each form and the situations covered, in the drivers' book of forms.</p>
        <p>1.1.3. Additional messages</p>
        <p>Additional messages are information messages used by the driver to inform the personnel in charge of traffic management or used by the personnel in charge of traffic management to advise the driver of certain predictable situations related to train running or to the technical condition of the train or the infrastructure.</p>
        <p>The necessary additional messages are identified by the infrastructure managers and are included in Appendix 1 %quot%Manual of communications procedures%quot% of the driver's rule book and in the documents of instructions for use by personnel in charge of traffic management.</p>
        <p>1.1.4. Information messages with a variable, content</p>
        <p>These messages shall be used, in some situations, by the driver to advise personnel in charge of traffic management on the ground about circumstances which are of a rare nature and for which predetermined messages are not provided.</p>
        <p>To make it easier to describe the situations and construct the information messages, a message model, a glossary of railway terminology, a descriptive diagram of the rolling stock being employed and a descriptive statement of the infrastructure equipment (track, traction supply, etc.) shall be drawn up.</p>
        <p>1.1.4.1. Model structure for messages</p>
        <p>%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2002245EN.039501.TIF%quot%%gt%</p>
        <p>These messages may be followed by a request for instructions.</p>
        <p>The elements of the messages are provided in both the language chosen by the railway undertaking and in those of the concerned infrastructure managers.</p>
        <p>1.1.4.2. Glossary of railway terminology</p>
        <p>The glossary of railway terminology shall be produced by the railway undertaking for each network traversed. It shall supply the terms in regular use in the language chosen by the railway undertaking and in those of the infrastructure managers whose infrastructure is worked over.</p>
        <p>It shall be composed of two parts:</p>
        <p>- a listing of terms by subject matter,</p>
        <p>- a listing of the terms in alphabetical order.</p>
        <p>1.1.4.3. Descriptive diagram of the rolling stock</p>
        <p>The descriptive diagram of the rolling stock used shall be prepared by the railway undertaking and shall list the names of the various components that may be the subject of communications with the different infrastructure managers concerned. It shall provide the common names for the standard terms in the language chosen by the railway undertaking and in those of the infrastructure managers whose infrastructure is worked over.</p>
        <p>1.1.4.4. Descriptive statement of the characteristics of the infrastructure equipment (track, traction supply, etc.)</p>
        <p>The descriptive statement of the characteristics of the infrastructure equipment (track, traction supply, etc.) on the route worked over shall be drawn up by the railway undertaking, showing the names of the various components that may be the subject of communications with the infrastructure managers concerned. It shall provide the common names for the standard terms in the language chosen by the railway undertaking and in the ones of the infrastructure managers whose infrastructure is worked over.</p>

        <p>Example: 10 December.</p>
        <p>2.2. COMMUNICATIONS STRUCTURE</p>
        <p>The voice transmission of safety-related messages shall in principle comprise two 2 phases as follows:</p>
        <p>- identification and request for instructions,</p>
        <p>- transmission of the message itself and termination of the transmission.</p>
        <p>The first phase may be cut back or entirely omitted for top priority safety messages.</p>
        <p>2.2.1. Rules for identification and requests for instruction</p>
        <p>To enable the parties to identify one another, define the operational situation and transmit procedural instructions, the following rules shall apply:</p>
        <p>2.2.1.1. Identification</p>
        <p>Every communication other than top priority safety messages must begin with identification messages even after an interruption during transmission.</p>
        <p>The following messages shall be used for this purpose by the different parties.</p>
        <p>- by the personnel responsible for traffic management:</p>
        <p>train ...</p>
        <p>... (number)</p>
        <p>this is ... ... signals</p>
        <p>... (name)</p>
        <p>- by the driver:</p>
        <p>... signals</p>
        <p>... (name)</p>
        <p>this is train ...</p>
        <p>... (number)</p>
        <p>NB:</p>
        <p>The identification may be followed by an additional information message giving the person responsible for traffic management enough details of the situation to determine precisely the procedure that the driver may subsequently be required to follow.</p>
        <p>2.2.1.2. Request for instructions</p>
        <p>Every application of a procedure must be preceded by a request for instructions. The following terms shall be used to request instructions:</p>
        <p>prepare procedure ...</p>
        <p>2.2.2. Rules for message transmission procedures</p>
        <p>2.2.2.1. Top priority safety messages</p>
        <p>Due to their urgent and imperative nature, these messages:</p>
        <p>- may be sent or received while running,</p>
        <p>- may omit the identification part,</p>
        <p>- shall be repeated,</p>
        <p>- shall, as soon as possible, be followed by further information.</p>
        <p>2.2.2.2. Procedural message</p>
        <p>In order to reliably send (at a standstill) the procedural messages contained in the book of forms (livret formulaires), the following rules shall be followed.</p>
        <p>2.2.2.2.1. Message sending</p>
        <p>The form may be completed prior to transmitting the message so that the full text of the message can be sent in one single transmission.</p>
        <p>2.2.2.2.2. Message receiving</p>
        <p>The receiver of the message must fill in the form given in the book of forms based upon the information given by the sender.</p>
        <p>2.2.2.2.3. Read back</p>
        <p>All the predetermined railway messages in the book of forms shall be required to be read back. The read back shall include the message shown in the grey field on the forms, the report back section and any additional or complementary information.</p>
        <p>2.2.2.2.4. Acknowledgement of correct read back</p>
        <p>Every read-back message shall be followed by an acknowledgement of conformity or non-conformity given by the sender of the message:</p>
        <p>correct</p>
        <p>or</p>
        <p>error + I say again</p>
        <p>and resending of the initial message.</p>
        <p>2.2.2.2.5. Acknowledgement</p>
        <p>Every message received shall be acknowledged positively or negatively as follows:</p>
        <p>received</p>
        <p>or</p>
        <p>negative, say again (+ speak slowly)</p>
        <p>2.2.2.2.6. Traceability and verification</p>
        <p>A unique identification or authorisation number shall accompany all messages initiated from the ground:</p>
        <p>- if the message concerns an action for which the driver requires a specific authorisation (e.g. passing a signal at danger, etc.):</p>
        <p>authorisation ...</p>
        <p>... (number)</p>
        <p>- in all other cases (e.g. proceeding with caution, etc.):</p>
        <p>message ...</p>
        <p>... (number)</p>
        <p>2.2.2.2.7. Reporting back</p>
        <p>Every message comprising a request to %quot%report back%quot% shall be followed by a %quot%report%quot%.</p>
        <p>2.2.2.3. Additional messages</p>
        <p>Additional messages</p>
        <p>- shall be preceded by the identification procedure,</p>
        <p>- shall be short and precise (limited wherever possible to information to be communicated and where it applies),</p>
        <p>- shall be read back and followed by an acknowledgement of correct read back, or not,</p>
        <p>- may be followed by a request for instructions or a request for further information.</p>
        <p>2.2.2.4. Information messages with a variable content not predetermined</p>
        <p>Information messages with a variable content shall be:</p>
        <p>- preceded by the identification procedure,</p>
        <p>- prepared before sending,</p>
        <p>- read back and followed by an acknowledgement of correct read back, or not.</p>
