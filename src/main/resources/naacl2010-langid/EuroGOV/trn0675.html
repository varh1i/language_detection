        <p>Commission Regulation (EC) No 1334/2002</p>
        <p>of 23 July 2002</p>
        <p>laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1638/98 as regards the work programmes of operators organisations in the olive sector for the marketing years 2002/03 and 2003/04</p>
        <p>THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1638/98 of 20 July 1998 amending Regulation No 136/66/EEC on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1513/2001(2), and in particular the second indent of the first subparagraph of Article 4a(3) and Article 4a(4) thereof,</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) Article 4a(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1638/98 provides that, under the common organisation of the market in oils and fats, in force as from 1 November 2002, Member States producing olive oil may withhold within certain limits a portion of aid, where appropriate intended for olive oil and/or table olive producers, to ensure Community finance of work programmes drawn up by approved operators' organisations. It should be laid down that the work programmes in question cover the marketing years 2002/03 and 2003/04 only, in accordance with Regulation No 136/66/EEC of the Council of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1513/2001.</p>
        <p>(2) To ensure that approved operators' organisations are effective, approval must relate to the various categories of operators having a major impact in the olive oil and/or table olives sectors, while ensuring that those organisations are large enough to obtain economically significant results. Member States should also be able, with respect to local situations, to lay down additional approval criteria to ensure that the approved organisations have sufficient capacity.</p>
        <p>(3) To ensure efficient administrative management of the system of approved operators' organisations in the olive sector, the procedures and time limits for the approval of such organisations, the criteria for selecting their work programmes and the arrangements for paying Community funding should be laid down.</p>
        <p>(4) To ensure overall consistency between the activities of approved operators' organisations in the olive sector, it is necessary to lay down the types of activities that are eligible for Community funding and the selection criteria for the work programmes. The Member States concerned should, however, be allowed to lay down additional eligibility conditions so as to gear activities more closely to national realities in the olive sector.</p>
        <p>(5) To allow work to commence in good time, operators' organisations in the olive sector should be able to receive an advance on the approved Community funding, subject to the lodging of a security under the terms laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1932/1999(5).</p>
        <p>(6) For the purposes of proper management of the rules on operators' organisations in the olive sector, the Member States concerned should draw up a control plan and specify a system of penalties for any irregularities committed. Provision should also be made for operators' organisations to notify the results of their work to the national authorities in the Member States concerned and to transmit those results to the Commission.</p>
        <p>(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,</p>
        <p>HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>

For the purposes of payment of the Community funding under Article 4a of Regulation (EC) No 1638/98 or, where appropriate, the balance thereof, operators' organisations in the olive sector shall lodge, by a date to be determined by the Member State but no later than 31 January 2005, an application with the competent national authority.</p>

        <p>2. To be admissible the applications referred to in paragraph 1 shall be accompanied by</p>
        <p>(a) supporting documents proving:</p>
        <p>(i) the expenditure effected in the period concerned;</p>
        <p>(ii) where appropriate, payment of the financial contributions of the operators and the Member State concerned;</p>

        <p>3. In the case of activities completed by 31 October 2004 and for which payment is made after that deadline, the Community funding shall be reduced by 1 % per day late in the first 30 days and by 2 % for each day thereafter.</p>
        <p>4. During the three months following the month in which the full application file referred to in paragraph 1 is lodged, and once they have carried out the examination of the documents referred to in paragraph 2 and the checks referred to in Article 10, Member States shall pay the Community funding that is due and release the corresponding security.</p>
        <p>Article 10</p>
        <p>Checks and penalties</p>
        <p>1. Member States shall verify that the conditions for granting Community funding are met, in particular as regards compliance with the approval requirements, implementation of the approved work programmes, the expenditure actually implemented and the financial contribution by the olive operators concerned. To that end, they shall carry out a control plan involving a sample determined on the basis of a risk analysis and comprising at least 30 % of producers organisations in the olive sector and all the other operators' organisations in the olive sector in receipt of Community funding under this Regulation.</p>
        <p>2. Member States shall specify or, as appropriate, lay down a system of penalties for irregularities under this Regulation. Those penalties must be effective, proportionate and act as a deterrent and comprise, for the most serious cases, withdrawal of approval and financial penalties of an amount at least double that of the Community funding involved in the irregularity.</p>
        <p>3. Under the system of controls referred to in paragraph 1, an individual file shall be opened on each operators' organisation in the olive sector that has been subject to checks. These files shall include proof of the verifications and checks carried out and, where appropriate, an indication of the anomalies found and the penalties applied.</p>
