        <p>The explanatory notes to the Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities [2] shall be amended as follows:</p>

        <p>8528 "According to General rule 3(c) for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, video surveillance systems, consisting of a limited number of television cameras and one video monitor, fall within this heading when put up in a set for retail sale.</p>
        <p>The components of such video surveillance systems are to be classified separately when the system is not put up in a set for retail sale (See HS Explantory Notes to Section XVI (VII))."</p>
        <p>On page 339:</p>
        <p>8529 "This heading does not include tripods for use with cameras of heading 8525 or Chapter 90 (classification according to constituent material)."</p>

        <p>These subheadings do not include waveguides (classification of the tubes according to constituent material)."</p>
