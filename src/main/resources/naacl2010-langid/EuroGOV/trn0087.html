        <p>Commission Decision</p>
        <p>of 18 July 2005</p>
        <p>adjusting the weightings applicable from 1 August, 1 September, 1 October, 1 November and 1 December 2004 and from 1 January 2005 to the remuneration of officials, temporary staff and contract staff of the European Communities serving in third countries and of certain officials remaining in post in the 10 new Member States for a maximum period of 15 months after accession (Article 33(4) of the Treaty on the accession of the 10 new Member States)</p>
        <p>(2005/569/EC)</p>
        <p>THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities and the conditions of employment of other servants of the Communities laid down by Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 [1], and in particular the second paragraph of Article 13 of Annex X thereto,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty of Accession of the 10 new Member States, and in particular Article 33(4) thereof,</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 257/2005 [2] fixed, pursuant to the first paragraph of Article 13 of Annex X to the Staff Regulations, the weightings to be applied from 1 July 2004 to the remuneration payable in the currency of the country of employment of officials, temporary staff and contract staff of the European Communities serving in third countries and of certain officials remaining in post in the 10 new Member States for a maximum period of 15 months after accession.</p>
        <p>(2) Some of these weightings need to be adjusted in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 13 of Annex X to the Staff Regulations, with effect from 1 August, 1 September, 1 October, 1 November and 1 December 2004 and from 1 January 2005 because the statistics available to the Commission show that in certain third countries the variation in the cost of living measured on the basis of the weighting and the corresponding exchange rate has exceeded 5 % since weightings were last laid down or adjusted,</p>
        <p>HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
        <p>Sole Article</p>
        <p>From 1 August, 1 September, 1 October, 1 November and 1 December 2004 and 1 January 2005 the weightings applicable to the remuneration payable in the currency of the country of employment of officials, temporary staff and contract staff of the European Communities serving in third countries and of certain officials remaining in post in the 10 new Member States for a maximum period of fifteen months after accession shall be adjusted as shown in the Annex hereto.</p>
        <p>The exchange rates for the calculation of such remuneration shall be those used for implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the month preceding the dates referred to in the first paragraph.</p>
