        <p>(2) In order to make it easier to draw up and manage the budget for Community food aid actions and to enable the Member States to know the extent of Community participation in the financing of national food aid actions, the level of the refunds granted for these actions should be determined.</p>
        <p>(3) The general and implementing rules provided for in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 on export refunds are applicable mutatis mutandis to the abovementioned operations.</p>
        <p>(4) The specific criteria to be used for calculating the export refund on rice are set out in Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95.</p>
        <p>(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,</p>

        <p>Article 1</p>
        <p>For Community and national food aid operations under international agreements or other supplementary programmes, and other Community free supply measures, the refunds applicable to cereals and rice sector products shall be as set out in the Annex.</p>
        <p>Article 2</p>
        <p>This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 December 2004.</p>
