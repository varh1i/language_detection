        <p>Failure of a Member State to fulfil obligations — Incorrect implementation of Articles 2(1), 4(2), 5(2) and 8 of Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment — Failure to carry out an impact assessment in respect of urban development projects at White City and Crystal Palace</p>

        <p>The Court:</p>
        <p>1. Declares that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has failed to fulfil its obligations under Community law by incorrectly transposing into domestic law Articles 2(1) and 4(2) of Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, as amended by Council Directive 97/11/EC of 3 March 1997, as a result of the national rules under which, in the case of outline planning permission with a requirement of subsequent approval of the reserved matters, an assessment may be carried out only at the initial stage of granting such permission, and not at the later reserved matters stage;</p>
        <p>2. Dismisses the action as to the remainder;</p>
        <p>3. Orders the Commission of the European Communities and the United Kingdom to bear their own costs.</p>
