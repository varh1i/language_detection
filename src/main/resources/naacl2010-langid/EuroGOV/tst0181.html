        <p>Commission Decision</p>
        <p>of 10 November 2006</p>
        <p>granting certain parties an exemption from the extension to certain bicycle parts of the anti-dumping duty on bicycles originating in the People’s Republic of China imposed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2474/93, last maintained and amended by Regulation (EC) No 1095/2005, and lifting the suspension of the payment of the anti-dumping duty extended to certain bicycle parts originating in the People’s Republic of China granted to certain parties pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 88/97</p>
        <p>(2006/772/EC)</p>
        <p>THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community [1] (the basic Regulation),</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 71/97 of 10 January 1997 extending the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 2474/93 on bicycles originating in the People’s Republic of China to imports of certain bicycle parts from the People’s Republic of China, and levying the extended duty on such imports registered under Regulation (EC) No 703/96 [2] (the extending Regulation), maintained by Council Regulation (EC) No 1524/2000 [3],</p>
        <p>Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 88/97 of 20 January 1997 on the authorisation of the exemption of imports of certain bicycle parts originating in the People’s Republic of China from the extension by Council Regulation (EC) No 71/97 of the anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2474/93 [4] (the exemption Regulation), maintained by Regulation (EC) No 1524, and in particular Article 7 thereof,</p>
        <p>After consulting the Advisory Committee,</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) After the entry into force of the exemption Regulation, a number of bicycle assemblers submitted requests pursuant to Article 3 of that Regulation for exemption from the anti-dumping duty as extended to imports of certain bicycle parts from the People’s Republic of China by Regulation (EC) No 71/97 (the extended anti-dumping duty). The Commission has published in the Official Journal of the European Union successive lists of applicants [5] for which the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty in respect of their imports of essential bicycle parts declared for free circulation was suspended pursuant to Article 5(1) of the exemption Regulation.</p>
        <p>(2) Following the last publication of the list of parties under examination [6], a period of examination has been selected. This period was defined as from 1 January to 31 December 2005. A questionnaire was sent to all parties under examination, requesting information on the assembly operations conducted during the relevant period of examination.</p>
        <p>A. REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION FOR WHICH SUSPENSION WAS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED</p>
        <p>A.1. Acceptable requests for exemption</p>
        <p>(3) The Commission received from the parties listed in Table 1 below all the information required for the determination of the admissibility of their requests. The information provided was examined and verified, where necessary, at the premises of the parties concerned. Based on this information, the Commission found that the requests submitted by the parties listed in Table 1 are admissible pursuant to Article 4(1) of the exemption Regulation.</p>

        <p>(4) The facts as finally ascertained by the Commission show that for 24 of these applicants’ bicycle assembly operations, the value of the parts originating in the People’s Republic of China which were used in their assembly operations was lower than 60 % of the total value of the parts used in these assembly operations, and they, therefore, fall outside the scope of Article 13(2) of the basic Regulation.</p>
        <p>(5) Concerning the last party, although the facts show that the value of the parts originating in the People’s Republic of China which were used in its assembly operations was above 60 % of the total value of the parts used in the assembly operations, the value added was above 25 % of the manufacturing costs. Therefore the assembly operations of that party fall outside the scope of Article 13(2) of the basic Regulation.</p>
        <p>(6) For these reasons, and in accordance with Article 7(1) of the exemption Regulation, the parties listed in the above table should be exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty.</p>
        <p>(7) In accordance with Article 7(2) of the exemption Regulation, the exemption of the parties listed in Table 1 from the extended anti-dumping duty should take effect as from the date of receipt of their requests. In addition, their customs debt in respect of the extended anti-dumping duty is to be considered void as from the date of receipt of their requests for exemption.</p>
        <p>(8) It is to be noted that the following five parties listed in Table 1 informed the Commission services of a change in their name and/or in their legal seat, or transfer of assembly activity, during the examination period:</p>
        <p>- %quot%Athletic International Sp. z o.o., ul. Drawska 21, 02-202 Warsaw, Poland%quot% transferred its assembly activity to %quot%Athletic Manufacturing Sp. z o.o., ul. Drawska 21, 02-202 Warsaw, Poland%quot%,</p>
        <p>- %quot%Avantisbike — Fabrico de bicicletas SA, Rua do Casarão, 3750-869 Borralha, Portugal%quot% transferred its legal seat to %quot%Zona Industrial de Oiã (Sul), Lt. B17, 3770-059 Oiã, Portugal%quot%,</p>
        <p>- %quot%CSEKE Trade Kft., Gyepsor u. 1., 1211 Budapest, Hungary%quot% transferred its legal seat to %quot%Központi út 21–47., 1211 Budapest, Hungary%quot%,</p>
        <p>- %quot%Firma Wielobranżowa ART-POL — Artur Nowak, ul. Romera 4/20, 42-200 Częstochowa, Poland%quot% changed its name to %quot%Firma Wielobranżowa %quot%Mexller%quot% Artur Nowak, ul. Romera 4/20, 42-200 Częstochowa, Poland%quot%,</p>
        <p>- %quot%PFIFF Vertriebs GmbH, Wilhelmstraße 58, 49610 Quakenbrück, Germany%quot% transferred its legal seat to %quot%Wilhelmstraße 49, 49610 Quakenbrück, Germany%quot%.</p>
        <p>(9) It has been established that these changes in the name and/or legal seat and transfer of assembly activity did not affect the assembly operations with regard to the stipulations of the exemption Regulation and therefore the Commission does not consider that these changes should affect the exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty.</p>
        <p>A.2. Unacceptable requests for exemption and withdrawals</p>
        <p>(10) The parties listed in Table 2 below also submitted requests for exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty.</p>
        <p>Table 2</p>

        <p>A.J. Maias Lda. | Estrada Nacional N.o 1, Malaposta, Apart. 27, 3781-908 Sangalhos | Portugal | A401 |</p>

        <p>P.W.U.H. Sterna | ul. Lotników 51, 73-102 Stargard Szczeciński | Poland | A631 |</p>
        <p>(11) Four parties withdrew their request for exemption and informed the Commission accordingly.</p>
        <p>(12) One party failed to submit the requested information required for the examination of its request. For this reason, and in accordance with Article 7(3) of the exemption Regulation, the Commission informed this party that it intended to reject its request for exemption. This party was given an opportunity to comment. No comments were received.</p>
        <p>(13) Another party did not use the bicycle parts for the production or assembly of bicycles during the examination period, nor did it inform the Commission that it destroyed or re-exported them, which constitutes a breach of the obligations set out in Article 6(2) of the exemption Regulation. The party was informed accordingly and given an opportunity to comment. No comments were received.</p>
        <p>(14) Since the parties listed in Table 2 failed to meet the criteria for exemption set by Article 6(2) of the exemption Regulation, the Commission has to reject their requests for exemption, in accordance with Article 7(3) of the Regulation. In the light of this, the suspension of the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty referred to in Article 5 of the exemption Regulation must be lifted and the extended anti-dumping duty must be collected as from the date of receipt of the requests submitted by these parties.</p>
        <p>A.3. Request for exemption requiring further examination</p>
        <p>(15) The party listed in Table 3 below also submitted a request for exemption from the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty.</p>
        <p>Table 3</p>
        <p>Name | Address | Country | TARIC additional code |</p>
        <p>ROG Kolesa, d.d. | Letališka 29, 1000 Ljubljana | Slovenia | A538 |</p>
        <p>(16) As regards this party, the Commission services were not in a position to verify whether the assembly operations of this party fall outside the scope of Article 13(2) of the basic Regulation due to the bankruptcy procedure of the party instituted by the Bankruptcy Penal Tribunal held by the District Court of Ljubljana.</p>
        <p>(17) In light of the above, the party listed in Table 3 should be maintained in the list of parties under examination. The payment of the anti-dumping duty in respect of the imports of essential bicycle parts declared for free circulation by this party should remain suspended.</p>
        <p>B. REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION FOR WHICH SUSPENSION WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY GRANTED</p>
        <p>B.1. Inadmissible requests for exemption</p>
        <p>(18) The parties listed in Table 4 also submitted requests for exemption from the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty:</p>
        <p>Table 4</p>
        <p>Name | Address | Country |</p>
        <p>Firma Bikeland | ul. 15 Sierpnia 17, 96-500 Sochaczew | Poland |</p>

        <p>NV Simons | Staatsbaan 279, 3460 Bekkevoort | Belgium |</p>
        <p>(19) With regard to these parties, it should be noted that their requests did not meet the admissibility criteria set out in Article 4(1) of the exemption Regulation.</p>
        <p>(20) Two applicants use essential bicycle parts for the production or assembly of bicycles in quantities below 300 units per type on a monthly basis.</p>
        <p>(21) One applicant did not provide prima facie evidence that its assembly operations fell outside the scope of Article 13(2) of the basic Regulation, notably prima facie evidence that the value of the parts originating in the People’s Republic of China, which were used in their assembly operations, was lower than 60 % of the total value of the parts used in these assembly operations.</p>
        <p>(22) These parties were informed accordingly and were given an opportunity to comment. No comments were received. As a consequence, no suspension was granted to these parties.</p>
        <p>B.2. Admissible requests for exemption for which suspension should be granted</p>
        <p>(23) Interested parties are hereby informed of the receipt of further requests for exemption, pursuant to Article 3 of the exemption Regulation, from parties listed in Table 5. The suspension from the extended duty, following these requests, should take effect as shown in the column headed %quot%Date of effect%quot%:</p>
