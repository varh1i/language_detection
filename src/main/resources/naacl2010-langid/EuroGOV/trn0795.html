        <p>1. On 4 November 2005, the Commission received a notification of a proposed concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 [1] by which the undertaking Industri Kapital (the Netherlands) acquires within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Council Regulation control of the whole of the undertaking GUS Holland Holding (%quot%GUS Holding%quot%, the Netherlands) belonging to GUS plc (UK) by way of purchase of shares.</p>
        <p>2. The business activities of the undertakings concerned are:</p>
        <p>- for undertaking Industri Kapital: private investment firm,</p>
        <p>- for undertaking GUS Holding: retail home shopping in the Netherlands and consumer credit, and debt collection.</p>
        <p>3. On preliminary examination, the Commission finds that the notified transaction could fall within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 139/2004.
