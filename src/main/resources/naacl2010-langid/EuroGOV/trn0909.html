        <p>Agreement</p>
        <p>between the European Union and the Republic of Bulgaria establishing a framework for the participation of the Republic of Bulgaria in the EU crisis management operations</p>
        <p>THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
        <p>of the one part, and</p>
        <p>THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA,</p>
        <p>of the other part,</p>
        <p>hereinafter referred to as the "Parties",</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) The European Union may decide to take action in the field of crisis management.</p>
        <p>(2) The European Union will decide whether third states will be invited to participate in an EU crisis management operation. The Republic of Bulgaria may accept the invitation by the European Union and offer its contribution. In such case, the European Union will decide on the acceptance of the proposed contribution of the Republic of Bulgaria.</p>
        <p>(3) If the European Union decides to undertake a military crisis management operation with recourse to NATO assets and capabilities, the Republic of Bulgaria may express its intention in principle of taking part in the operation.</p>
        <p>(4) The European Council at Brussels on 24 and 25 October 2002 has agreed modalities for implementation of the provisions agreed by the Nice European Council on 7 to 9 December 2000 on the involvement of the non-EU European NATO members in EU-led crisis management.</p>
        <p>(5) Conditions regarding the participation of the Republic of Bulgaria in EU crisis management operations should be laid down in an Agreement establishing a framework for such possible future participation, rather than defining these conditions on a case-by-case basis for each operation concerned.</p>
        <p>(6) Such an Agreement should be without prejudice to the decision-making autonomy of the European Union, and should not prejudge the case-by-case nature of the decisions of the Republic of Bulgaria to participate in an EU crisis management operation.</p>
        <p>(7) Such an Agreement should only address future EU crisis management operations and should be without prejudice to possible existing agreements regulating the participation of the Republic of Bulgaria in an already deployed EU crisis management operation,</p>
        <p>HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:</p>
        <p>SECTION I</p>
        <p>GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
        <p>Article 1</p>
        <p>Decisions relating to the participation</p>
        <p>1. Following the decision of the European Union to invite the Republic of Bulgaria to participate in an EU crisis management operation, and once the Republic of Bulgaria has decided to participate, the Republic of Bulgaria shall provide information on its proposed contribution to the European Union.</p>
        <p>2. Where the European Union has decided to undertake a military crisis management operation with recourse to NATO assets and capabilities, the Republic of Bulgaria will inform the European Union of any intention to participate in the operation, and subsequently provide information on any proposed contribution.</p>
        <p>3. The assessment by the European Union of the Republic of Bulgaria's contribution shall be conducted in consultation with the Republic of Bulgaria.</p>
        <p>4. The European Union will provide the Republic of Bulgaria with an early indication of the likely contribution to the common costs of the operation as soon as possible with a view to assisting the Republic of Bulgaria in the formulation of its offer.</p>
        <p>5. The European Union shall communicate the outcome of the assessment to the Republic of Bulgaria by letter with a view to securing the participation of the Republic of Bulgaria in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</p>
