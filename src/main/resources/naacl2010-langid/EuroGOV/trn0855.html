        <p>Commission Regulation (EC) No 165/2005</p>
        <p>of 31 January 2005</p>
        <p>fixing the import duties in the cereals sector applicable from 1 February 2005</p>
        <p>THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals [1],</p>
        <p>Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 of 28 June 1996 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards import duties in the cereals sector [2], and in particular Article 2(1) thereof,</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 provides that the rates of duty in the Common Customs Tariff are to be charged on import of the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation. However, in the case of the products referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article, the import duty is to be equal to the intervention price valid for such products on importation and increased by 55 %, minus the cif import price applicable to the consignment in question. However, that duty may not exceed the rate of duty in the Common Customs Tariff.</p>
        <p>(2) Pursuant to Article 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003, the cif import prices are calculated on the basis of the representative prices for the product in question on the world market.</p>
        <p>(3) Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 lays down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 as regards import duties in the cereals sector.</p>
        <p>(4) The import duties are applicable until new duties are fixed and enter into force.</p>
        <p>(5) In order to allow the import duty system to function normally, the representative market rates recorded during a reference period should be used for calculating the duties.</p>
        <p>(6) Application of Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 results in import duties being fixed as set out in Annex I to this Regulation,</p>
        <p>HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p>
        <p>Article 1</p>
        <p>The import duties in the cereals sector referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 shall be those fixed in Annex I to this Regulation on the basis of the information given in Annex II.</p>
        <p>Article 2</p>
        <p>This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 February 2005.</p>
        <p>This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p>
