        <p>Statement on Council Regulation (EC) No 851/2005 of 2 June 2005 amending Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 as regards the reciprocity mechanism [1]</p>
        <p>(2005/C 172/01)</p>
        <p>The Council and the Commission stress that the mechanism which is the subject of this Regulation, accompanied where necessary by provisional introduction of the visa requirement for a third country which imposes a visa requirement for nationals from one or more Member States, in no way prevents the application of other provisional measures to such a third country in one or more other fields (particularly political, economic or commercial fields) in accordance with the relevant legal basis or bases in the Treaties if such measures would be deemed an advisable part of the strategy to be implemented to induce the third country to restore visa-free travel for nationals from the Member State or States concerned.</p>
        <p>The Council and the Commission consider that, when one or other of the notifications provided for in Articles 1 and 2 of this Regulation occurs, due consideration should be given in the appropriate fora to the advisability of such other measures.</p>
