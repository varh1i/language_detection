      <div type="body">
        <p>Decision No 507/2001/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council</p>
        <p>of 12 March 2001</p>
        <p>concerning a set of actions relating to the trans-European network for the collection, production and dissemination of statistics on the trading of goods within the Community and between the Community and non-member countries (Edicom)</p>
        <p>THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285 thereof,</p>
        <p>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),</p>
        <p>Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(2),</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) The actions implemented pursuant to Council Decision 96/715/EC of 9 December 1996 on inter-administration telematic networks for statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States (Edicom)(3) have made it possible to improve considerably the quality of intra-Community statistics.</p>
        <p>(2) Statistics for foreign trade and for trade within the Community are entering a new phase of development, characterised by growing and increasingly demanding user need for information.</p>
        <p>(3) It is necessary to meet the urgent need of the Economic and Monetary Union by the rapid provision of reliable and accurate macroeconomic statistics.</p>
        <p>(4) The modernisation of the trans-European network for the collection, production and dissemination of statistics on the trading of goods within the Community and between the Community and non-member countries should be a driving force in the development of these statistics.</p>
        <p>(5) Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91 of 7 November 1991 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States(4) (Intrastat) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1172/95 of 22 May 1995 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods by the Community and its Member States with non-member countries(5) provide for increased use of automatic processing and electronic data transmission.</p>
        <p>(6) Simplification of the Intrastat system was a pilot project in the SLIM (%quot%Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market%quot%) initiative launched in 1996; the measures for reducing the workload on statistical information providers, in particular SMEs, which have been approved by the European Parliament and the Council, should be continued.</p>
        <p>(7) The objectives of this Decision are adequate and compatible with those of Decisions No 1719/1999/EC(6) and No 1720/1999/EC(7) of the European Parliament and the Council on trans-European networks for the electronic interchange of data between administrations (IDA); account should also be taken of IDA decisions, in particular Article 11 of Decision No 1719/1999/EC, in implementing this Decision.</p>
        <p>(8) An ex-ante evaluation has been performed in accordance with the financial management rules, in order to focus the programme on the need for effectiveness in achieving the objectives and to incorporate budgetary constraints from the design phase of the programme onwards.</p>
        <p>(9) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely the development and modernisation of the trans-European network for the collection, processing and dissemination of intra- and extra-Community trade statistics, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of their scale, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.</p>
        <p>(10) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics(8) provides the regulatory framework for the provisions of this Decision, particularly those relating to access to administrative data sources, statistical confidentiality and the principle of cost-effectiveness.</p>
        <p>(11) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(9).</p>
        <p>(12) This Decision establishes a financial framework for the entire duration of the programme which is to be the principal point of reference for the budgetary authority, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure(10),</p>
        <p>HAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
        <p>Article 1</p>
        <p>Field of application and general objectives</p>
        <p>1. The measures provided for by this Decision relate to the trans-European network for the collection, production and dissemination of statistics on the trading of goods within the Community and between the Community and non-member countries.</p>
        <p>2. The general objectives are as follows:</p>
        <p>(a) to encourage the organisation of the network referred to in paragraph 1 in the most modern, rational and effective manner possible and to adopt measures necessary for improving and harmonising the methods used, in order to produce statistics which:</p>
        <p>- are more reliable and less expensive for the information providers and administrations, and become available more quickly;</p>
        <p>- better satisfy the existing and future expectations of users;</p>
        <p>(b) further to develop existing computer tools for the collection, production, transmission and dissemination of statistical data, taking into account the latest technological advances and seeking to optimise cost-effectiveness.</p>
        <p>Article 2</p>
        <p>Actions</p>
        <p>1. To achieve the objectives referred to in Article 1, a set of actions (known as the %quot%Edicom%quot% programme) shall be implemented for:</p>
        <p>(a) the development of the network referred to in Article 1(1) in order to:</p>
        <p>- produce statistical information which is of better quality, less costly and available more quickly, in order to satisfy the requirements of Community policies;</p>
        <p>- produce statistical information that is relevant and appropriate to the new needs of users within the framework of Economic and Monetary Union and the changing international economic environment;</p>
        <p>- incorporate statistics on the trading of goods more effectively into the general statistical system at Community and international level and adapt them to changes in the administrative environment;</p>
        <p>- improve the service offered to administrations, suppliers and users of information, by providing them with all the available statistics and metadata relating to the trading of goods;</p>
        <p>(b) the development and promotion of tools for collecting information on the trading of goods, by taking into account the latest technological advances in order to improve the functions available to information providers.</p>
