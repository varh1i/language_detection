        <p>COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 251 (2) of the EC Treaty concerning the</p>
        <p>common position of the Council on the adoption of a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008)</p>
        <p>1. BACKGROUND</p>
        <p>Date of transmission of the proposal to the EP and the Council (document COM(2005) 467 final â€“ 2005/0203(COD)): | 6 October 2005 |</p>
        <p>Date of the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee: | 20 April 2006 |</p>
        <p>Date of the opinion of the European Committee of the Regions: | 27 April 2006 |</p>
        <p>Date of the opinion of the European Parliament, first reading: | 1 June 2006 |</p>
        <p>Date of the revised proposal of the Commission (document COM(2006) 492 final): | 5 September 2006 |</p>
        <p>Date of adoption of the common position: | 13 November 2006 |</p>
        <p>2. OBJECTIVE OF THE COMMISSION PROPOSAL</p>
        <p>Based on Treaty Article 151, the proposal is to declare 2008 to be the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.</p>
        <p>Intercultural dialogue is intimately linked to the fundamental ambition underlying the construction of Europe, namely to bring together the peoples of Europe. It should therefore be a priority throughout the EU to call upon European citizens, and all those living in the European Union, to play a full part in managing our diversity, which is enriched by all new migration flows, greater mobility as well as by the changes and additions brought about by globalisation.</p>
        <p>Moreover, intercultural dialogue is an instrument which could facilitate the implementation of a series of strategic priorities for the Union.</p>
        <p>A European Year devoted to intercultural dialogue constitutes a unique awareness-raising tool for affirming this priority and involving citizens. It is intended to provide momentum to what should be a long-lasting, sustainable process.</p>
        <p>3. COMMENTS ON THE COMMON POSITION</p>
        <p>The common position adopted by the Council on 13 November 2006 by unanimity is the result of negotiations between the three institutions and represents a compromise acceptable for all of them. In comparison with the amended proposal of the Commission, which itself accepted a large number of amendments voted by the European Parliament in first reading, the changes are minor and are of technical and linguistic character.</p>
        <p>4. CONCLUSION</p>
        <p>The Commission considers that the common position adopted on 13 November 2006 by unanimity is appropriate and it can therefore support it.</p>
