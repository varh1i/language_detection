        <p>THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market [1], and in particular Article 9(4) thereof,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market [2], and in particular Article 10(4) thereof,</p>
        <p>Having regard to Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC [3], and in particular Article 66(2) thereof,</p>
        <p>Whereas:</p>
        <p>(1) Following an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 in a poultry flock on its territory, Hungary has taken the appropriate measures as provided for in Commission Decision 2006/415/EC of 14 June 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 in poultry in the Community and repealing Decision 2006/135/EC [4].</p>
        <p>(2) In the light of the further development of the epidemiological situation in Hungary it is necessary to prolong the measures established for areas A and B in accordance with point (b)(iii) of Article 4(4) of Decision 2006/415/EC.</p>
        <p>(3) Denmark has notified to the Commission that all control measures in relation to an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 in a backyard poultry holding have been ceased by 30 June 2006 and therefore the measures established in accordance with Article 4(2) of that Decision for areas A and B are no longer necessary.</p>
        <p>(4) It is therefore necessary to amend Parts A and B of the Annex to Decision 2006/415/EC accordingly.</p>
        <p>(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,</p>
        <p>HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p>
        <p>Article 1</p>
        <p>The Annex to Decision 2006/415/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.</p>
        <p>Article 2</p>
        <p>This Decision is addressed to the Member States.</p>
