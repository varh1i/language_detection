  The 15 defendants all pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial 
Prosecutors have called for jail terms of up to 20 years for 15 men on trial in Uzbekistan charged with attempting to lead an Islamic insurgency. 
All 15 pleaded guilty when the court proceedings opened last month but the United Nations has voiced grave concern about the trial's conduct. 
They are accused of leading an armed uprising which shook the eastern town of Andijan in May. 
The protests ended in bloodshed and hundreds of people were killed. 
The Uzbek government says 187 people, mostly "terrorist organisers", died but human rights groups say 500 or more civilians may have been killed, shot by Uzbek security forces. Deputy Prosecutor General Anvar Nabiyev asked the court to sentence five of the men on trial to 20 years in prison, and give the others terms ranging from 15 to 19 years. 
"Under the guise of social protection, the Islamic extremists staged anti-people actions that resulted in the death of peaceful civilians, government workers and law enforcement agents," he said. 
'Show trial' 
All of the witnesses have joined defendants in backing the government's account of events, with the exception of one woman. 
Makhbuba Zakirova told the court two weeks ago that she saw soldiers shooting at people waving a white flag. 
"There were people in helmets everywhere. I twice saw soldiers shooting from military vehicles. The shooting was intense," she said at the time. 
All 15 men have pleaded "fully guilty" to the charges, which include terrorism, shooting hostages and belonging to banned Islamic groups. 
A former Uzbek interior ministry employee told the BBC that beatings or psychotropic drugs are often used to force confessions - an allegation denied by the Uzbek government. 
The UN commission on human rights says in a statement that there have been serious inadequacies in the conduct of the trial: 
Consistent testimony by eyewitnesses suggests that Uzbek security forces committed grave human rights violations while curbing the protest 
The crime of terrorism, which the 15 have been accused of, is not adequately defined 
Little evidence has been presented during the trial 
The defendants have not been cross-examined by independent lawyers 
The fact that the defendants all confessed their guilt on the first day raises concerns that the confessions may have been obtained by torture. 
The judge is expected to pass sentence in the coming days.
