  Ulfa has been fighting Indian forces for 26 years 
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has held talks with representatives of a leading separatist group from the north-eastern state of Assam. 
An 11-member group representing the United Liberation Front of Assam (Ulfa) is in Delhi for talks aimed at ending nearly 25 years of insurgency. 
The government said the talks were "cordial and friendly", but would not say if sovereignty had been discussed. 
More than 10,000 people have died in the rebel fight for independence. 
Sovereignty issue 
India's national security adviser and the chief minister of Assam were also present at the talks. 
The prime minister's spokesman, Sanjay Baru, told journalists the meeting had been held in two sessions and had lasted more than two hours. 
"The prime minister has agreed to discuss all issues. But he also said that he is a servant of the Indian constitution. 
"So, he requested the members to recognise the complexity of the polity," said Mr Baru. 
However, Mr Baru refused to comment on whether the prime minister had agreed to discuss the issue of sovereignty, a ceasefire or the release of jailed Ulfa leaders. 
Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi and a spokesman for the delegation also declined to comment on what had been discussed. 
Ahead of the talks, the peace delegation had said they would raise all three issues. 
Operations ceased 
The representative group includes human rights activists, journalists and writers among others. 
Last month, the Indian army called off a counter-insurgency operation against Ulfa rebels in Assam to facilitate the current peace talks. 
Ulfa is one of the most powerful of nearly a dozen separatist groups fighting Indian security forces in the north-east. 
Most rebel groups in Assam, including the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) have started negotiations with Delhi. 
Several Ulfa leaders held talks with the Indian government in 1992, but the talks failed to yield results.
