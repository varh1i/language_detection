"We (the department) acted on the basis of information and the whole process began about two months ago," he told reporters. 
Some 300 tax inspectors were reported to have begun the raids early on Wednesday morning and were expected to continue through the night. 
"Our raids are still on and you will soon come to know about others," Mr Datta said. 
News of the raids on such well-known personalities has made headlines across India.
