  The bus was carrying border police troops 
An Indian border guard has been killed and more than 25 others injured in a car bomb attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, officials say. 
The blast came as a bus carrying soldiers of India's Border Security Force was passing by on the outskirts of the state capital, Srinagar. 
At least five civilians are among those injured, the authorities say. 
There has been no let up in violence in Indian-administered Kashmir despite the recent earthquake in the region.

The latest attack took place along the main highway linking Srinagar, the state's summer capital, with the northern town of Baramullah. 
The condition of many of those injured was described as being serious. 
"We are awaiting details. The casualties could be higher," the AFP news agency quoted an unnamed police spokesman as saying. 
"The bus was part of a convoy moving towards Baramulla town," he said. 
Militant claim 
Reports quote eyewitnesses as saying that the car and the bus have been severely damaged. 
  
The Hizbul Mujahideen, one of the most powerful militant groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir, says it carried out the bombing. 
Violence has continued in Kashmir despite the 8 October earthquake, which killed more than 1,400 people in Indian-administered Kashmir. 
More than 50,000 died on the Pakistani side of the Line of Control and in North West Frontier Province. 
Last week, the state education minister was killed in a militant attack in Srinagar. 
Following the earthquake, an umbrella body of militant groups, the United Jihad Council, said it had called a temporary halt to operations against Indian security forces. 
But the Indian army said there had been no let-up in separatist violence in Kashmir despite the earthquake.
