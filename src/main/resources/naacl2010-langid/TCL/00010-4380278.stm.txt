  Investors are keen to tap into China's economic potential 
Trading in shares of China Construction Bank has started slightly higher than the Chinese lender's $8bn (£4.5bn) initial public offering (IPO). 
The stocks debuted at the Hong Kong market at HK$2.375 ($0.306), a meagre 1.06% premium to the IPO price of HK$2.35 ($0.303). 
On Wednesday, the bank's shares dropped 1% on the unofficial "grey" market. 
China Construction's share listing is the world's biggest this year, and the largest ever by a Chinese company. 
Overseas investors have been keen to tap into China's economic potential. 
'Lacklustre sentiment' 
Traders said earlier that concern about bird flu in the region had also dented sentiment on Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock market. 
    It'll be a pleasant surprise if China Construction Bank's shares can end higher than its IPO price on its debut Francis Lun, general manager of Fulbright Securities 
"Given the current lacklustre sentiment, it'll be a pleasant surprise if China Construction Bank's shares can end higher than its IPO price on its debut," said Francis Lun, general manager of Fulbright Securities. 
As China's third biggest bank, China Construction holds assets worth $521m and has a 13% share of total deposits in the country. 
Despite some worries over the exposure of Chinese banks to bad debt, accumulated after years of state-controlled lending, interest in China Construction's IPO has been strong. 
Shares made available to smaller investors earlier this month were 42 times oversubscribed . 
"China Construction Bank may lose one or two percent when it first opens, but as one of the biggest banks in China it will do well in the long term," said Alfred Chan, of Cheer Pearl Investment. 
China Construction's IPO is expected to be followed next year by Bank of China, followed by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in 2007.
