  The WTC's twin towers were destroyed in 2001 
A US jury has ruled that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was negligent in the 1993 truck bombing of the World Trade Center (WTC). 
The six-person jury's decision means that the Port Authority can be sued for damages, setting the stage for a potential avalanche of lawsuits. 
Six people died and some 1,000 were hurt when the truck bomb was detonated in the WTC's underground garage. 
The WTC's twin towers were destroyed in 2001 by the al-Qaeda plane hijackers. 
'Substantial factor' 
The six-member jury in New York ruled that the Port Authority had failed to keep the garage reasonably safe on 26 February 1993 - the date of the attack. 
It said that the negligence was a "substantial factor" in allowing the attackers to detonate some 500kg of explosives placed in the rented truck. 
The jury faced the awkward task of judging the case without taking into account the destruction of the twin towers eight years later when two hijacked airliners were crashed into them. 
The presiding judge banned lawyers from mentioning the 11 September 2001 attacks. 
Lawyers in the case say the Port Authority could face multimillion lawsuits from hundreds of plaintiffs.
