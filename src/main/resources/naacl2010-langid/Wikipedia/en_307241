The '''North American AJ Savage''' (later '''A-2 Savage''') was a carrier-based  built for the  by .  The original contract was awarded in June 1946, first flight 3 July 1948, and the plane entered service in 1949.<ref name=USN>[http://www.history.navy.mil/download/app1-1.pdf US Navy History: ''AJ Savage''] p.458</ref>
The AJ Savage was a large composite-powered carrier-borne Attack Bomber designed to deliver . It also performed photo reconnaissance duties and later on was used as an aerial refuelling platform. The North American AJ-1/2 and AJ-1/2P Savage aircraft were in a number of USN Heavy Attack Composite squadrons from 1948â€“1956, as well as in several Photographic Reconnaissance squadrons. The Heavy Attack versions were the first nuclear bomb carrying bombers able to be launched from and recovered on aircraft carriers. The date of its inception was a time where the US Navy was faced with procuring the nascent jet engine, while still having to rely upon the simple yet well proven reciprocating engine. Jets at this time were unreliable and used large quantities of fuel, however, once they were developed, they produced performance that no piston engine could ever provide. A compromise was made to include in the Savage two  piston engines, with a large turbocharger fitted inside each engine nacelle.  This combination made it possible for the P&W engines to produce rated power (2500 HP) up to 42,000 feet altitude.  An   was fitted in the rear fuselage. Interestingly, both engine types used the same fuel. The piston-turbojet arrangement was intended to give added power on take-off and extra dash speed while in combat.  At high altitude, this 'boxy' looking (but aerodynamically very clean) airplane was remarkably fast -- Greater than 400 knots, when the jets of that era were not very much faster.
 
The first production Savage flew in May 1949, with the first carrier landing of the type taking place on the  on .
Early model Savages (AJ-1) were converted to the air tanker role, with the bomb bay filled with all the necessary equipment, including hoses, fuel pumps, electric power drive, and the drogue. Additional fuel was provided in drop tanks.
The AJ-2 first flew on   and had uprated engines and a taller vertical stabilizer and non-dihedral tailplane.
The AJ-2P was the photographic reconnaissance version of the Savage. It carried photo-flash bombs for night missions, with most of the plane's 18 cameras being operated automatically. It was capable of night and low-level reconnaissance. The -2P also had additional fuel capacity.
