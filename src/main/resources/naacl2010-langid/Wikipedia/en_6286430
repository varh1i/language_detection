Fearful that the precious s would be scattered and never recovered, the Egyptian government sent Drioton to acquire as much of the collection as he could.
Cairo antiquities dealer Phocian J. Tano had acquired most of the collection from these outlaws, but had already sold one  to Maria Dattari, a private  in Cairo. Dattari offered the collection to the Egyptian government for 71,000+ sterling, which was negotiated down to 45,000 sterling.
An antiquities law was quickly modified to include the artifacts, which made both the Tano and Dattari collections the legal property of the Egyptian government. At that time, Drioton took immediate possession of them, and ordered them sequestered until a proper course of action could be determined by the courts.

Two Cairo antique dealers, Maurice Nahman and Phocion J. Tano, fearful perhaps of losing business, quickly spread rumors that the Mansoor Amarna objects were .
