The '''Mendocino Fracture Zone''' is a  and  off the coast of  in far northern .  It runs westward from a triple junction with the  and the  to the southern end of the .  It continues on west of its junction with the Gorda Ridge, as an inactive remnant section which extends for several hundred miles.
Technically, a fracture zone is not a transform fault, but in the case of the Mendocino, the term has been loosely applied to the active fault segment east of the Gorda Ridge as well as to the true fracture zone segment west of it.  Many seismologists refer to the active segment as the '''Mendocino Fault''' or '''Mendocino fault zone'''.  The fault section demarcates the boundary between the northwestward-moving  and the eastward-moving .  The Gorda Plate is subducting beneath the North American Plate just offshore of Cape Mendocino.  Where the Mendocino Fault intersects the undersea trench of the subduction zone, it also meets the .  This seismically active intersection is called a .
