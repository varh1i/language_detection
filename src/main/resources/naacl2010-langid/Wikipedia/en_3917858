Per WP:WIAFA 1c. Citations are conspicuously absent from important sections like "History".
Per WP:WIAFA 1d. Neutrality cannot be ascertained unless there is a good number of citations backing the text. Regards.-- () 07:25, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
'''Comment''' Thanks for the comments.  I will fix up the history section and will get proper citations. Been busy with University stuff so havent had much time to fix this up.  21:33, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
'''Extra-strong support'''Awesome article, five stars! I t has every little detail, and really should have been chosen first time around, but as they say, first time you mess up, try again!    -
'''Oppose''' until citations are added and copyedit made. Feel free to strike this once you're done.  <sup></sup>‚ÅÑ<sub></sub> <small>&bull;&nbsp;18:31, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</small>
