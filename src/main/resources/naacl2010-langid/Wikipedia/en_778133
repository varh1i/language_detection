'''Hans Herrmann''' (born , ) is a former  and  driver from , .  
In F1, he participated in 19 World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on , . He achieved 1 podium, and scored a total of 10 championship points.
In , he also scored the first overall win at the  for  in 1970, on a .
The racing career of Herrmann, who is a baker by trade, spans from cooperation with pre-war legends like  to the beginning of the dominance of  at the . He took part in now legendary road races like ,  and  and is one of the few remaining witnesses of this era. ''Hans im Glück'' (lucky John) escaped from several spectacular incidents or accidents.
Herrmann had a remarkable  race in 1954, when the gates of a railroad crossing were lowered in the last moment before the fast train to Rome passed. Driving a very low  Spyder, Herrmann decided it was too late for a brake attempt anyway, knocked on the back of the helmet of his navigator  to make him duck, and they barely passed below the gates and before the train, to the surprise of the spectators. 
From 1954 to 1955, he was part of the  factory team, as a junior driver behind , ,  and later . When the  came back for the 1954  to score a 1-2 win, Herrmann drove the fastest lap but had to retire. A podium finish at the  was his best result in that year as he had to use older versions of the , or the least reliable car. 
In the  his team mates Kling and Moss had to abandon early due to the extremely hot conditions on the southern hemisphere in January. Herrmann was called in to share his car with them for a 4th place finish, giving one point each. Fangio won with two laps more. 
Hans was quick in the 1955  with the , comparably or even faster than Moss, but was less lucky than in 1954, as he had to abandon the race.
A crash in practise for the  put Herrmann out for the ill-fated 1955 season, even though a comeback in the  was intended.
The next years saw Herrmann racing for many marques, in F1 for ,  an . In Berlin's  during the  the brakes of his BRM failed, he crashed in a spectacular way, being thrown out of the car and sliding along the track with the car somersaulting in the air.
With different versions of the  being used as a sportscar and as , Herrmann scored some wins for Porsche, mainly both the 1960  and . When it was turned into a  in 1961 due to the rule changes, the results in F1 were disappointing. Herrmann finished 15th (last) in the , which was one of only two races in F1 history to have no retirements. He left Porsche at the beginning of the 1962 season feeling that he as a local from Stuttgart was ''No Prophet In His Own Land'' compared to Californian  and 1959 GP-winner  from Sweden. Gurney scored two F1 wins with the new , but Porsche retired from F1 anyway at the end of 1962.
With the small Italian  cars, Herrmann spend 1962 to 1965 with minor races and , winning only lesser  events like eg. on the  or the  in the overall category. The Abarths were hard to beat in their classes from 850cc to 1600cc, though. Being the only pro in a small team, he learned a lot about testing and developing, which helped him later. Being dissatisfied with the preparation of his car for the 1965  practice, Hans just went home to witness the birth of his son, Dino. At the end of the year he left Abarth for good, to return to the manufacturer closer to his home.
In 1966 he returned to Porsche for a comeback in the , as Porsche started a serious effort there. Following several podium finishes with the still underpowered 2 Liter  and later models, he won the 1968  in a 907 as well as the  again, now together with Swiss . The overall win of the  always eluded him, even though Herrmann had taken part in each of these races at the  since they were introduced in 1953, and had finished second three times in a row from 1968 to 1970, behind team mates  and/or .
Herrmann missed the win in the 1969  with a  by only 120 Meters [http://www.imca-slotracing.com/images/908LH-LeMans69.jpg], but it was he who finally scored the long-awaited first overall victory at the  for Porsche in 1970. In heavy rain, he and his team mate  survived with their red and white K #23 as the best of only 7 finishers.
As promised to his wife before the race, the 42 year old immediately retired, having witnessed fatal accidents of colleagues too many times, eg. before the  when his team mate and neighbor  died.
Using his contacts, Herrmann built a successful company for automotive supplies. He was kidnapped once in the 1990s and kept in a car trunk for many hours before escaping.
Hans, at age 75 and older, still drives his old race cars at meetings, with a big smile in the open-face helmet, and a heavy right foot.
