Away upon the mountain top,
The breezes blow mild,
Where, Mary, sweet mother dear,
Is rock-ing her child.
She cradles Him so tenderly,
In arms snowy white,
Enfolds Him in her loving care
And sings through the night:
Halelujah, halelujah! :|
The Baby wakes from slumber deep,
And looks to the sky.
Great peace shall come to all the earth
Thru God's gift from on high.
The angels sing this holy night,
"All praise to the King,
The Prince of Peace, the Son of God,
His birth we do sing."
Halelujah, halelujah!
