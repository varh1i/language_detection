The original album included fourteen songs, but when it was released in the United States in 1996 the setlist included only eleven songs.

The American release was also reviewed by critics as a 'mid-'90s R&B/pop phenomenon' due to the removal of the few pop/rock songs on the album and also due to five songs being remixed and being heavily influenced by R&B. "Not Enough in the World", "Paradise Is Here", "Angels Running", "What About the Moonlight" and "One by One" were remixed and labeled as album versions in the United States. Their new genre included pop and R&B, however their original versions were influenced by pop/rock. Because of the new change, the American release was also compared to  '''' which at the time showed a new change in Madonna's music. The album was also compared to the style of . One critic Jose F.
