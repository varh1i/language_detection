'''Degree of curve''' or '''degree of curvature''' is a measure of  used in  for its easy use in layout .
A ''n''-degree curve turns ''n''  over some agreed-upon distance.  The usual distance is 100  of , but 100 feet of  is also common, and other lengths&mdash;such as 100 s where  is favoured, or a shorter length for sharper curves.
The 100 foot is a station, used to define length along an alignment.  Annotated as 1+00, 2+00 etc.
Typically roads are defined in arcs, and since rail routes have very large radii, the are laid out in chords, as the difference to the arc is inconsequential.  
Beware though, the degree of curvature, as typically defined in civil literature, is for a 100' ''chord''.
