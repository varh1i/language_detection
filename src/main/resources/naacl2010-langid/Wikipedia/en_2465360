Just today came out of an extremely rare screening of this film in its entirety and would like to work on it as much as possible immediately, while my memory (and access to external sources) is still very fresh! (It's 12+ hours long, btw...) Would love to see this really polished up nicely for a possible FA nom. Thanks!  02:11, 24 April 2006 (UTC)
