'''Baseball Prospectus''', sometimes abbreviated as '''BP''', is a  focusing on , the statistical analysis of the sport of .  Baseball Prospectus has fathered several popular new statistical tools which have become hallmarks of baseball analysis.
Baseball Prospectus was founded in 1996 by , who recruited the initial contributor group of , , , and , with the publication of the first annual set of forecasts.  The analysis and statistics favored by Baseball Prospectus has in various forms gained significant acceptance by the management of many  clubs, notably the  and . BP has often been considered the modern successor to ' ''Baseball Abstract'' series of books in the 1980s.<ref>See, for example, James Fraser, "'Baseball Prospectus' — Escaping Bill James' Shadow," ''By the Numbers'' (Newsletter of the SABR Statistical Analysis Committee) 10, No. 2 (May 2000).</ref>
As a legal entity, the organization is known as Prospectus Entertainment Ventures, . Reflecting its legacy as a group of sabermetricians who met over the Internet, BP has no "main office." Working for BP is a second or part-time job for most of the regular staff, who conduct their work for BP in their own home or professional offices. 
Prospectus Entertainment Ventures partners with  for the publication and promotion of ''ProFootball Prospectus'' (ISBN 0452288479).
On October 10, 2007, BP launched [http://www.basketballprospectus.com BasketballProspectus.com], a new website for the analysis of men's college and pro basketball, with  taking the role of [http://basketballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=6 Managing Editor] and announcing the lineup of principal writer-analysts for the site. Unlike BaseballProspectus.com, this website is free and does not require a subscription for full access.  BP also plans to begin publishing an annual book, ''College Basketball Prospectus'', beginning with the 2008 season.<ref>Nate Silver, "BasketballProspectus.com Launches in October," [http://baseballprospectus.com/unfiltered/?p=521 BaseballProspectus/Unfiltered], September 10, 2007.</ref>
Baseball Prospectus creates several products:
The website BaseballProspectus.com began in 1997 primarily as a way to present original  research; publish advanced baseball statistics such as , the , and ; and promote sales of the annual book.  Beginning in 2003, the site placed most of its new articles, its  forecasts, and some of its statistical databases in a “premium” section that could be accessed only by subscription.
Until 2007, when the site began to post general advertising, the premium subscriptions and book sales were Baseball Prospectus' main source of revenues.  Baseball Prospectus does not publish a financial report or information about its subscriber base, but it appears to be using its income to expand its breadth of coverage to attract new customers,<ref>Nate Silver, "The State of the Prospectus: Now Serving Beer . . . and Tacos," [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=4800 BaseballProspectus.com, February 27, 2006]; and Nate Silver, "State of the Prospectus: New Features," [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=5736 BaseballProspectus.com, December 1, 2006].</ref> and it has not increased its subscription prices since initiating its premium service.  It also offers a subscription to those interested in , at a lower price than the premium subscriptions and giving access to fewer features and articles.
BaseballProspectus.com has a corps of staff writers who publish articles on a regular (typically weekly) basis under a featured heading (see list of "Regular Writers" below).  In addition, occasional articles are published by other BP staff or freelance authors.  Some former regular writers no longer appear on the site but can be found writing for other media or employed on the staffs of major league baseball organizations, including as of 2007 the <ref> is [http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/team/front_office.jsp?c_id=cle Manager of Baseball Research & Analytics] for the Indians.

Although the site maintains its sabermetric core and has expanded its statistical databases (most of which are open to non-subscribers), it now regularly attends to issues such as baseball prospects (the  and ), international baseball, the economics and business of baseball (valuation of players, team and stadium finances, the player marketplace)<ref>This carries on the tradition established by the late , who wrote regularly for BP from 2001 until his untimely death in 2004.</ref>, and  (PECOTA, the "Fantasy Focus" series of articles, forecast manager and other fantasy tools).  As BP has begun in addition to publish monographs on specialized topics, it has delved into the application of sabermetric analysis to historical topics – an emphasis clearly seen in ''Mind Game'' (2005 – a history of the Boston Red Sox), ''Baseball Between the Numbers'' (2006 – which addresses some historical comparisons), and ''It Ain’t Over 'til It’s Over'' (2007 – about historical pennant races).
Baseball Prospectus writers promote several theories on proper baseball management and analysis, many of which are contrary to those of conventional baseball wisdom.
Baseball Prospectus researchers have concluded that there is no repeatable ability of . As writer  said, "Over the course of a game, a month, a season or a career, there is virtually no evidence that any player or group of players possesses an ability to outperform his established level of ability in clutch situations, however defined."<ref>{{cite news|title=The Concept of ''Clutch''|first=Joe|last=Sheehan|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=2656|work=Baseball Prospectus Basics}}</ref> They cite studies which find that there is insignificant correlation between year-to-year performance in clutch situations.
In an article published in 2006,  argued that clutch hitting ability does exist to a degree. He argued that although not as important as traditional baseball analysis would suggest, clutch hitting ability was more significant than other  studies had shown.  The article also found there to be a connection between clutch hitting ability and situational hitting, or the ability to adjust a hitting approach to fit the given situation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Silver|first=Nate|editor=Jonah Keri|title =Baseball Between the Numbers: Why Everything You Know about the Game Is Wrong|year=2006|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-00596-9|pages=14-34}}</ref>
Baseball Prospectus writers often argue that traditional baseball statistics such as , , and  are poor reflections of a player's true contributions. For example, they have argued that RBIs are too dependent on factors outside of the player's control, namely the production of other hitters in the lineup.<ref>{{cite book|last=Keri|first=Jonah|editor=Jonah Keri|title =Baseball Between the Numbers: Why Everything You Know about the Game Is Wrong|year=2006|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-00596-9|pages=1-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Measuring Offense|first=Dayn|last=Perry|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=2562|work=Baseball Prospectus Basics}}</ref> They similarly argue that wins are too affected by factors such as the team's offense and bullpen.<ref>{{cite book|first=Dayn|last=Perry|coauthors=Woolner, Keith|editor=Jonah Keri|title =Baseball Between the Numbers: Why Everything You Know about the Game Is Wrong|year=2006|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-00596-9|pages=49-50}}</ref>
Baseball Prospectus writers assert that teams are typically inefficient in their use of their best . Teams typically assign their most effective reliever to the position of , using him in only  (when the team is leading by fewer than four runs in the 9th inning). According to many Baseball Prospectus writers, a team's best reliever should be used when the opposing team has its best chance at increasing its chances of winning.<ref>{{cite news|title=How to Run a Bullpen|first=Derek|last=Zumsteg|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=2603|work=Baseball Prospectus Basics}}</ref>
Many writers argue that the  and  are overused in baseball. Teams will often attempt these plays when the score is close. Writers for Baseball Prospectus often argue that teams are, on average, actually lowering their expected number of runs scored. They argue that stolen base attempts are not completed frequently enough for them to be beneficial to the offense.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stolen Bases and How to Use Them|first=Joe|last=Sheehan|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=2607|work=Baseball Prospectus Basics}}</ref> For sacrifice bunts, they argue that the team is giving up more by sacrificing an out than they gain by advancing a runner one base. Their thinking is derived from the grid of expected runs in an inning based on the outs and runner situation, which shows that the sacrifice is detrimental to a team given average players in most of the situations in which it is typically used.<ref>Run expectancy matrix available [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=2844 here for all users] and [http://baseballprospectus.com/statistics/sortable/index.php?cid=100051 here for paid subscribers].</ref>
In a series of articles in 2004, James Click argued that sacrifice bunts are beneficial in some situations, dependent on the quality of the batter at the plate and the situation in the game.<ref>{{cite news|title=When Does it Make Sense to Sacrifice?|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=2844|first=James|last=Click|format=links to part 1 of series}}</ref>
Baseball Prospectus writers use a wide variety of sabermetric tools. Among the major tools that they are credited with inventing are:

Baseball Prospectus, as well as other  analysts, are criticized for taking the human aspect out of the game of baseball. For example,  of the  wrote in an article that he did not want to hear or read about new-age baseball statistics any more (referencing  specifically), saying: <blockquote>"I suppose that if stats mongers want to sit at their computers and play with these things all day long, that’s their prerogative. But their attempt to introduce these new-age statistics into the game threatens to undermine most fans’ enjoyment of baseball and the human factor therein. People play baseball. Numbers don’t."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/sports/baseball/27chass.html?ex=1178683200&en=9d1d9a339e780519&ei=5070 |title=As Season Approaches, Some Topics Should Be Off Limits |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2007-05-07}}</ref></blockquote>
Nate Silver responded to this criticism in "An Open Letter to Murray Chass," including offering to meet Chass to watch a ballgame.<ref>Nate Silver, "An Open Letter to Murray Chass,"[http://www.baseballprospectus.com/unfiltered/?p=233 BaseballProspectus.com, February 27, 2007].</ref>  He expounded on the case for a positive impact of sabermetrics on the game of baseball in an article "How Sabermetrics Helps Build a Better Ballgame," published on Baseball Analysts.com.<ref>Nate Silver, "How Sabermetrics Helps Build a Better Ballgame," [http://baseballanalysts.com/archives/2007/05/how_sabermetric_1.php Baseball Analysts, May 10, 2007].</ref>
Another type of criticism comes from those who believe that by broadening its coverage and audience, Baseball Prospectus is becoming more like the mainstream media and losing what made it unique. In response to a question along this line in an on-line chat, Silver wrote:<blockquote>From a brand standpoint, we're more concerned about differentiation based on quality than differentiation based on where we fall on sort of the "saberpolitical" spectrum. We brought people like Kevin [Goldstein] and Bryan Smith on because [they're] the absolute best at what they do.<ref>Nate Silver, "Chat," [http://www.baseballprospectus.com/chat/chat.php?chatId=321 BaseballProspectus.com, June 27, 2007].</ref></blockquote>
