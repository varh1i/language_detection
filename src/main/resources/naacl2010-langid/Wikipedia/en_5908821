The '''''' was the large-scale  of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time, approximately {{Ma|65.5}} (mya). It is associated with a geological signature, usually a thin band dated to that time and found in various parts of the world, known as the . The event marks the end of the  Era, and the beginning of the  Era. Non-   are only found below the Kâ€“T boundary and became extinct immediately before or during the event. s, s, s and many  of s and s also became extinct.   and bird  passed through the boundary with few extinctions, and  from those  clades occurred well past the boundary. Many scientists theorize that the K-T extinctions were caused by one or more catastrophic events such as massive  or increased .  Several  and massive volcanic activity in the  have been dated to the approximate time of the extinction event. These geological events may have reduced  and hindered , leading to a massive disruption in Earth's .  Other researchers believe the extinction was more gradual, resulting from slower changes in  or . ('''''')</div>
