Each of the six episodes features a particular environment and, using a combination of aerial photography and traditional wildlife footage, reveals how physical forces and human activity have transformed Australasia from a lush green wilderness into an increasingly dry and harsh continent, troubled by unpredictable weather but still home to a huge array of creatures found nowhere else on Earth..
''Wild Down Under'' was co-produced by the , the  (ABC) and . The series was produced for the BBC by  and executive-produced for ABC by Dione Gilmour. The music was composed by Adrian Johnston and performed by the . The series was narrated by Australian actor .
The series forms part of the Natural History Unit's ''Continents'' strand. It was preceded by '''' in  and followed four years later by ''''.
''Wild Down Under'' is one of the most comprehensive surveys of Australasia's natural history ever filmed, with production of the series taking three years<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/programmes/tv/wilddownunder/ BBC ''Wild Down Under'']</ref>. The aerial photography used extensively in the series was shot by Damon Smith.
As well as mainland Australia, the production team visited other locations across the continent for the fifth episode, "Island Arks", including , ,  and .

Broadcast  2003, the first episode provides an overview of Australia's natural history.  gives a glimpse of Australia's lush forests of the past. A group of s are filmed squabbling over a  carcass. In eastern Australia, buckling formed the , high enough to attract snowfall. s bulldoze the snow to reach buried grass and  hunt shrimp in the mountain streams. In the ancient tropical  of the , , s and s are filmed. s and s inhabit the more open eucalpyt woodlands, and s feed their chicks in the nest hole. As Australia dried out, many rivers became intermittent or turned to creeks. s attract wildlife such as flocks of  parrots, a sign of water to early explorers.They are curious, sociable birds, and are shown playing on branches and investigating the nest holes of s. In north Australia's wet season, the tropical wetlands of  attract millions of  and other water birds. When the land begins to dry out again, s must move to avoid being trapped in shrinking pools. Aerial photography is used to show features of Australia's deserts, such as parallel dunes and . A  hides from a , the world's deadliest snake, and a  digs out a . The  was formed 10,000 years ago as sea levels rose. At certain tides after a full moon, its s engage in the planet's greatest  event.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Wild Down Under | series = Wild Down Under | credits = Produced by Neil Nightingale and written by Melinda Barker | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2003-09-12}}</ref>
The second programme, broadcast  2003, examines the s of Australia's interior. These harsh environments make up two thirds of the land area. Vast areas support nothing but tough  grass, indigestible to most herbivores. Instead, s are the grazers of these grasslands. Inside the termite mound, a whole ecosystem flourishes; s eat the termites and  prey on both. s are one of the most successful animals in Australia's deserts, and a  is shown waiting alongside a pathway of ants. Mammals here are , staying underground during the heat of the day. Those featured include  and s. Waterholes attract huge numbers of birds, and es are shown being preyed on by a . Nearby,  hop around on the precipitous rock faces. The  is an important water source in central Australia and s gather here in large flocks to breed.  were originally brought over for transport, but now half a million roam the desert. s and aggressive s are shown hunting and scavenging on the desert floor. The  has the largest expanse of parallel s in the world, but s survive even here. Once thought to be an inland sea,  is normally an inhospitable . Every 30 years or so, exceptional rains charge rivers which flow inland, filling the lake. The waters trigger a rush to breed, attracting birds such as s in their thousands.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Desert Heart | series = Wild Down Under | credits = Produced by Jeni Cleversy and written by Susan Western | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2003-09-19}}</ref>
Broadcast  2003, the third instalment features the wildlife of Australasia's seas and coasts. On 's desert coastline, seas are lifeless apart from a few fertile pockets. s feed close to shore at . At , sharks and  pin a  shoal to the shore, filmed from the air and underwater. A pair of s joins the feeding frenzy. Shallow, sandy bays are ideal conditions for , browsed by s. In north Australia,  rains flush rich sediment into the ocean. At low tide, s and s emerge to feed on the exposed worms, snails and shellfish. The  brings warm water to the south coast. s and s raise their young in the impoverished waters of the , while  gather in the breeding season. The cold  skirts Australia's remote south west tip, where the seas are home to giant  forests and strange creatures. The  is camouflaged as seaweed, while the  uses its fins to walk across the seabed. At night, female s climb to high points on the reef to release their brood of larvae. In 's cold and nutrient-rich waters, s are filmed plunge-diving into a sardine shoal, which also attracts s. s stay close to shore to avoid sharks. s must negotiate a steep granite rockface and patrolling s to reach their nest burrows.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Southern Seas | series = Wild Down Under | credits = Produced by Hugh Pearson and written by Susan Western | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2003-09-26}}</ref>
Australia's  forests are the subject of the fourth programme, broadcast  2003. In the tropical north, male s fight over territory, but retreat to the trees as a  passes overhead. s stay above the snowline of the southern mountains to feed on the seed capsules of s. On the misty lower slopes, better soils enable the  to reach 100 metres, the tallest  in the world. Animals of these forests include s, s and s. Some gum trees survive in the arid conditions of the interior; the  even clings to rocky gorges. The eucalypts provide essential resources for wildlife. Their flowers attract nectar feeders such as s, s and es, which also act as pollinators. The koala has a special digestive system which enables it to stomach the toxic leaves. s are shown licking sap and sailing between trees, while termites attack the trees themselves. Gum trees are highly flammable and are adapted to cope with s: fresh shoots grow from buds protected by the insulating bark within weeks of a blaze. s nest deep inside the s along the  to avoid predatory s. The boughs can drop without warning, and those that fall into the river provide shelter for . The final scenes show red kangaroos bounding through a flooded forest – without periodic floods, the trees would not survive.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Gum Tree Country | series = Wild Down Under | credits = Produced by Mary Summerill | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2003-10-03}}</ref>
Broadcast  2003, this episode begins at Kakadu, a seasonal  and representative of the swamps that once stretched from north Australia to . The lush tropical forests of New Guinea are home to creatures such as s, s and 38 kinds of , as well as richly varied human cultures. Male  are filmed displaying at a  and mating. Further east, the submerged tips of extinct es support colourful reefs. s and  use  to avoid detection. s can swim great distances, enabling them to colonise remote volcanic islands. No terrestrial mammals have made it this far, but s such as the tube-nosed species feast on figs. On , the aerial displays of male s are filmed, and adult s regurgitate meals for their chicks.  is a remnant of the Australian land mass which broke away 80 million years ago. It has many unique species, especially lizards: the  is the largest of its kind. New Zealand lies on the edge of the continental land mass, and marine life drawn to its nutrient-rich seas include s and acrobatic s. On land, s have colonised the  and in the forests, s and s occupy ecological niches normally associated with mammals. Introduced species have decimated the native fauna, but many species survive on offshore islands. The , , ,  and  are all shown.<ref>{{cite episode | title = Island Arks | series = Wild Down Under | credits = Produced by Neil Nightingale and Hugh Pearson, written by Melinda Barker | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2003-10-10}}</ref>
The final instalment, broadcast  2003, explores man's impact on Australia's wildlife. The arrival of Europeans brought huge changes. Some creatures have benefited - golf courses provide perfect browse for kangaroos and a landfill site is an important feeding ground for  – but many have suffered. Early homesick colonisers tried to model the landscape on the English countryside, bringing with them animals which have since wreaked havoc. Millions of wild pigs now roam, destroying vegetation, damaging waterholes and eating birds' eggs. s, camels and s were also introduced and are out of control. s are supplanting native bees in the competition for nectar, and  prey on small s. 54 native s, birds and mammals, including the , have become extinct. Some which were presumed extinct have since been , including Australia's rarest mammal, . Scientists are still searching for the  after a single dead specimen was reported in 1990, but the , familiar to s, is more widespread than previously thought. On , rare fauna including s and s live amongst the oil wells, and a  drinks from a dripping air-conditioning unit. On Tasmania, devils and s are filmed scavenging food in a sheep farmer's shed. Modern cities can also be a refuge for wildlife. 30,000 es roost in ’s botanical gardens and feed on orchard fruit nearby, while paying tourists feed wild s in a  park.<ref>{{cite episode | title = New Worlds | series = Wild Down Under | credits = Produced by Mary Summerill | network = BBC | station = BBC Two | airdate = 2003-10-17}}</ref>
