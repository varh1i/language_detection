It is currently the second largest stadium in the United States.  This is due to a reduction of 1,300 seats because of a lawsuit on behalf of disabled patrons, ruled in March 2008.  It is the  stadium in the world, and the 31st largest sports venue in general (which includes auto racing and horse racing tracks, among others).{{ref|stadiumranking}}  There is one "extra seat" in  "reserved" by former head coach  for the then athletic director , although its location is not specified.{{ref|yost}} Home games are invariably sellouts, and residents of Ann Arbor are aware of "football Saturdays" because of the influx of traffic and business at local establishments. The size of the crowd in the stadium nearly matches the city's population of 114,000.
Michigan Stadium was designed with footings to allow the stadium's capacity to be expanded beyond 100,000. According to the University of Michigan Library's and Athletics Department's history of the stadium, then-athletic director  envisioned a day where 150,000 seats would be needed. To keep construction costs low at the time, the decision was made to build a smaller stadium than Yost envisioned but include the footings for future expansion.{{ref|maxsize}}
Michigan Stadium is also the site of University of Michigan main  ceremonies, though renovations in April 2008 led that year's ceremony to be moved to .<ref>http://michigantoday.umich.edu/2008/05/grad08.php</ref> 
Michigan Stadium's size is not entirely apparent to outside observers, as it is constructed partially below grade, leaving only the upper 20 rows (in most sections) visible from the outside. The stadium's original capacity was 72,000, but Yost made certain to install steel footings that could allow for expansion up to 200,000 seats. Initially, all seating consisted of wood bleachers. These were replaced with permanent metal seating in 1949 by Crisler, who had become athletic director. Longtime radio announcer  dubbed Michigan Stadium "The hole that Yost dug, Crisler paid for,  carpeted, and  fills every cotton-pickin' Saturday afternoon." Since 1975 &mdash; Bo Schembechler's seventh season as coach &mdash; the stadium has held over 100,000 fans for every home game. (The game against Indiana University on ,  was the last sub-100,000 attendance home game for Michigan.) Michigan's game versus  University on ,  was the 200th consecutive crowd of over 100,000 fans. Traditionally, when the game's attendance is announced, the   thanks the fans for "being part of the largest crowd watching a football game anywhere in America." The tradition was temporarily stopped in 1996, when Michigan Stadium's capacity was overtaken by that of , but resumed when it was expanded two years later.

On , , Michigan played  in the first game at Michigan Stadium. It was an instant success, and Michigan prevailed easily, 33-0.

Michigan had spoiled the formal dedication of  in  just five years earlier, and was victorious again in the contest played for the new dedication, besting the Buckeyes 21-0 before a capacity crowd of 84,401. In the early 1930's the UM installed electronic scoreboards and UM stadium thus became the first stadium in US history to have that technology.
From 1927 to 1968, the stadium's field was covered in natural grass. This was replaced with TartanTurf in 1969 to give players better traction. However, this surface was thought to be unforgiving on players' joints, and the stadium returned to natural turf in . This too became problematic, as the field's below-surface location near the water table made it difficult for grass to permanently take root. The field was converted to , an artificial surface designed to give grass-like playing characteristics, in 2003.
