This extremely simple pump was made of , and had no s, rods, s, s, or s.  It operated by the direct action of  on .  The mechanism consisted of two s.  As the steam condensed in one chamber, it acted as a  pump, while in the other chamber, steam was introduced under pressure and so it acted as a force pump.  At the end of every stroke, a  consisting of a small  ball moved slightly, causing the two chambers to swap functions from suction-pump to force-pump and vice versa.  The result was that the water was first suction pumped and then force pumped.

The pump ran automatically without attendance.  It was praised for its "extreme simplicity of construction, operation, compact form, high efficiency, economy, durability, and adaptability". Later designs were improved upon to enhance efficiency and to make the machine more accessible for inspection and repairs, thus reducing maintenance costs.
