'''Artificial Intelligence System''' is a  project being undertaken by Intelligence Realm, Inc. with the long-term goal of simulating the human brain in real time, complete with  and . They claim to have found, in research, the "mechanisms of knowledge representation in the brain which is equivalent to finding artificial intelligence" <ref>[http://www.intelligencerealm.com/aisystem/system_center/faq.php#Q23 Frequently Asked Questions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, and have now moved into the developmental phase.
The project's initial goal is recreating the largest brain simulation to date, performed by neuroscientist Eugene M. Izhikevich of The Nuerosciences Institute in San Diego, CA. Izhikevich simulated 100 billion neurons (the estimated number of neurons in the human brain) in 50 days using a cluster of 27 3-gigahertz processors <ref>[http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/izhikevich/human_brain_simulation/Blue_Brain.htm#Computer%20Model%20of%20the%20Human%20Brain Eugene M. Izhikevich, Large-Scale Simulation of the Human Brain<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. He extrapolated that a real-time simulation of the brain couldn't be achieved before 2016 <ref>[http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/izhikevich/human_brain_simulation/why.htm why did I do that?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. The project ultimately aims to disprove this prediction.
AIS is simulating the brain via an , and currently uses . The project utilizes the  distributed computing platform. Each work unit received by a volunteer simulates 100,000 s for 100 milliseconds at 5 millisecond timesteps (the estimated firing rate of a human neuron).
The application has four primary modules - for creating neurons, simulating neurons, visualizing neurons, and finally, knowledge acquisition. Though still in early development, the neuronal generator will eventually use  to generate neurons for simulation. The neuronal simulator uses mathematical models to simulate those neurons. It currently uses Hodgin-Huxley models but more models (perhaps hundreds) will be utilized in the future. The visualization software will allow the administrators to monitor and control the neuronal simulators. The knowledge acquisition module involves feeding information to the system and training it to build its knowledge base.
The AIS project has successfully simulated over 106 billion neurons as of July 12th, 2008 [http://www.intelligencerealm.com/aisystem/system.php AIS News Page]
