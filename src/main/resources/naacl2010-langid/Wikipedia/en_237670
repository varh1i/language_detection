A main problem was the longevity of the battery, which needed to last between 7 and 10 years. The solution the engineers came up with was to keep the battery pack between 60% and 40% charged, proving to be the "sweet spot" for extending the battery life to roughly that of the other car components.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/automobiles/autospecial/25battery.html Still Miles to Go for the Plug-In Vehicle - New York Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The surge in popularity for s and fuel-efficient hybrids in the automotive market has left Toyota Motor Corp facing an unusual problem: deepening shortages of the Prius <ref>[http://planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/49151/story.htm Planet Ark : Toyota Struggles to Meet Hybrid, Small Car Demand<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> . In order to combat future shortages, Toyota has announced plans to build the Prius in Blue Springs, Mississippi, and move Highlander production planned for there to Princeton, Indiana.
The Prius is a  (sometimes referred to as series-parallel), a vehicle that can be propelled by  (petrol) and/or electric power. Components of the system include:
The computer program used in the Prius shuts off the engine when the car is stopped, is reversing, or is descending hills, thereby dramatically decreasing fuel consumption in city driving . The 's on-board computer program determines when and how to use the engine, motor, or both to power the car and recharge the battery so as to maximize efficiency. Typically, a gasoline engine runs inefficiently at half-throttle, creating a choking condition called , a major reason for the inefficiency of gasoline engines compared to . The Prius minimizes pumping loss by using a high torque range as much as possible with the throttle fully open.  throttle control technology and Toyota's '''' (a torque combiner, electric drive, and computer control) are essential to this engine control. In addition to the immediate benefit of reducing fuel consumption and emissions, stopping the gasoline engine also improves the performance of the catalytic converter, as the exhaust gases from an idling engine tend to cool the catalyst below its optimal temperature.
Typical gasoline- or diesel-engined vehicles consume fuel when the vehicle is stopped, as is common in city driving. The Prius typically shuts down the gasoline engine and runs solely off the battery pack at low speeds and when stopped. A non-hybrid car also gets worse fuel consumption in city driving because its engine is continually used to accelerate the car to driving speed and then this energy is lost to friction brakes during stop-and-go driving. The Prius recaptures some of this energy by using regenerative braking to charge its battery pack while slowing down with its motor-generators in generator mode. For acceptable acceleration the IC engine on a "standard" car typically is much larger than needed for constant-speed travel. By using both a gasoline engine and electric motors for acceleration the Prius engine can be a smaller size and still provide acceptable acceleration. This means the greatest advantages of a hybrid are mainly in city driving, though factors including driving style, air conditioning use, and short trips may offset some of this advantage. The frequent starting and stopping of the Prius engine does not cause noticeable additional wear and tear or emission problems because the electric drive motors have enough power to quickly spin the engine to optimal speed (around 1,000 ) before fuel is admitted.
For any car,  losses, which vary roughly as the velocity squared due to air  are much greater on the highway than in low speed city driving. The Prius hybrid has less of an advantage in higher speed open road driving, typical of intercity driving. Nevertheless, the Prius still obtains improved fuel consumption under these circumstances since it can use a smaller and more efficient engine than would otherwise be required. The electric motor(s), powered by the battery pack, can provide the extra peak power needed for acceleration, passing and limited hill climbing. The lower weight, cross sectional area and lowest drag coefficient of a production car in the U.S. market (since the cancellation of the ) make the Prius a very efficient <ref>[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/calculatorSelectEngine.jsp?year=2008&make=Toyota&model=Prius Compare Old and New MPG Estimates<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="epa most">{{cite web |title=2008 Most and Least Fuel Efficient Vehicles (ranked by city mpg) |url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/best/bestworstNF.shtml |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency and United States Department of Energy |accessdate=2007-12-25}}</ref> highway traveler, getting {{mpg|45}} on the highway according to the U.S. EPA.

In the UK, the , an independent body charged with policing the rules of the advertising industry, ruled that a television advert for the Toyota Prius should not be broadcast again in the same form, having breached rules concerning misleading advertising. The advert claimed the Prius "emits up to one tonne less CO<sub>2</sub> per year," while on-screen text included: "1 tonne of CO<sub>2</sub> less than an equivalent family vehicle with a diesel engine. Average calculated on 20,000 km a year." Points of contention were the vehicles chosen for comparison, whether "''up to'' one tonne less" adequately communicated that reductions could be lower, and whether the distance used was appropriate: 20,000 km per year is around a U.S. car's average annual driving distance, while a UK car's is 13,440 km.<ref>{{cite web
An earlier complaint to the New Zealand Advertising Standards Authority, decision 03/360 2003 was also upheld. It was ruled that Toyota were in breach of the New Zealand advertising standards code of ethics, by claiming "up to 89% fewer smog forming emissions”. The figure was based on comparison with Euro 3 standards, which most new cars also met comfortably at the time.
A similar complaint was made in Australia and the UK in regards to an advertisement in ''National Geographic'' magazine, November 2002. However this case was dismissed.

Former CIA chief  drives a Prius because of its low fuel consumption. Woolsey claims that money that pays for imports of gasoline help fund terrorism and states hostile to the United States.

The Prius' onboard GPS navigation system (as well as other models, such as the Lexus, which use the same technology) is designed so that destinations cannot be entered while the vehicle is in motion. According to the owner's manual, this is done for the driver's own safety (so that he is not distracted by trying to operate the navigation system while driving the car). However, this feature has caused considerable complaints from many owners who travel with a passenger and who want to have the passenger operate the navigation system while the driver is driving. Some owners claim that this actually increases the danger, as pulling off a highway onto the shoulder to enter a destination and then attempting to merge back into traffic going at highway speeds may be more dangerous than simply having the passenger enter data while the driver concentrates on driving.
On Toyota Prius with model years 2005 and earlier, it is possible to override this lock-out by pressing the onscreen volume button in the menu and then tapping the upper left, lower left, upper left, lower left corners of the screen in that order.

When the vehicle is turned-on with the "start" button, it is ready to drive immediately with the electric motor, while electric pumps warm the engine with previously saved hot engine coolant, before the internal combustion engine is started. The delay between starting the car and starting the internal combustion engine is approximately seven seconds. The Asian and European versions of this vehicle provide a button labeled "EV" that maintains Electric Vehicle mode after start up, under most low-load driving conditions. This permits driving with low noise and no fuel consumption, and is advertised as a "quiet" option for short journeys, for example in residential areas at night, in the Asia manual. The car automatically reverts to normal mode if the battery becomes exhausted. The North American model does not have the "EV" button, although the "EV" mode is still supported internally by the Prius Hybrid Vehicle management computer.

Plug-in hybrids use a larger battery pack that is recharged from external sources in order to further reduce fuel consumption. The batteries in a production PHEV will be built to handle deeper discharge cycles without loss of lifespan such as those in the . Operation of the vehicle will be very similar to a normal hybrid, except that the electric operation will be more prevalent. In the case of a Prius PHEV, on the highway, the gasoline engine will operate as before, leaving the car with the same ability to accelerate and use freeways. Current converted Prius also operate in a high speed  which can reduce but not eliminate fuel consumption on the freeway. When driving in slower conditions or with light loads, the batteries will be used first in a  mode, allowing moderate commutes at low speeds (particularly under 41 mph/65 km/h) to be driven entirely on electricity. Once the batteries have been sufficiently discharged the car will automatically revert back to the  mode of the current stock Prius.
Evolving from the button project, The California Cars Initiative (CalCars)<ref>{{cite web | title = Plug-In Hybrids Use Cheaper, Cleaner, Domestic Energy | url = http://www.calcars.org}}</ref> converted a Prius in 2004, adding larger batteries and found out how to safely charge the batteries without affecting the hybrid system. Private companies EDrive Systems in the  and Amberjac Projects in the  announced plans to sell conversion kits in 2006 (pushed back to 2007).{{Fact|date=August 2007}} The most recent versions, such as from OEMTek.com<ref>{{cite web|title=OEMTek PHEV conversion|url=http://www.oemtek.com/}}</ref> in California use a new, patented advanced safe-format Lithium Battery from Valence Technology called Saphion. Using the advanced batteries increases the final price by an estimated US$12,000. The energy density and far more efficient utilization of these batteries provide around 20x the available power of the standard NiMH battery pack but at only double the weight. Tests show it capable of achieving > 30 miles (50 km) in all electric mode at speeds below 34 mph (55 km/h). The internal combustion engine starts only at higher speeds or when extra acceleration is needed. Fuel economy is improved to {{mpg|100}} - {{mpg|500}} <ref>{{cite web | title = Plug-in Hybrid Technology Kits Released |url = http://www.businessweek.com/autos/content/mar2006/bw20060303_978539.htm?chan=autos_hybrids+index+page_technology}}</ref> depending on driving conditions. City driving may be possible without using the ICE at all, eliminating the use of almost all liquid fuel in exchange for electrical energy.
PriusPlus<ref name="cci"/> is a similar project evolving from CalCars, using lead-acid batteries and a do-it-yourself kit. This conversion gives a car that has {{mpg|100}} under normal driving conditions. All-electric mode can be used for 10–12 miles in street driving. In January 2007 issue of , CalCars lead technical engineer, Ron Gremban, notes that drivers installing the CalCars Prius+ kit shouldn’t expect a 'positive financial payback.'<ref>{{cite web | title = You Tell Us: The Home Plug-In Hybrid Kit |url = http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/jan07/4824}}</ref> The kit adds {{convert|135|kg|lb|abbr=on}} to the car's weight, and increases efficiency. The lead-acid battery pack performance is reduced in cold weather, has a limited life of about 400 deep discharges, and must be recharged within a day to maintain this lifespan. The hope is, by the time the batteries need replacing, a better option will be on the market at a comparable price.
However, under certain conditions, an Argonne National Lab study<ref>[http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/HV/399.pdf Testing and Analysis of Three Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> showed that the Prius' blended power drivetrain made an extremely poor base for a plug-in hybrid. Specifically, with the increased use of electric power, and the internal combustion engine activating less frequently, the  never warmed up properly. As a result, the test cars' emissions actually increased over the stock version. The same study also tested a simpler series hybrid based on a Renault Kangoo, but not as rigorously. Nonetheless, some argue that a more capable series configuration would be a better base for a PHEV than HSD because the larger electric traction motor could handle the full range of speeds, thus conferring true all-electric capabilities and completely displacing petroleum use even at highway speeds. Also, while under charge-sustaining mode the internal combustion engine would act as a continuously-running , and would not suffer the same frequent cold-start problems inherent to the Prius design.
Additionally, a study conducted by the aforementioned CalCars concluded that a plug-in Prius would only make technological sense when paired with a relatively small battery pack. As batteries grow more capacious and petroleum displacement becomes a priority over baseline efficiency, the authors wrote, the more a series design is likely to become the rational choice.<ref>[http://www.greencarcongress.com/2008/03/calcars-weighs.html Green Car Congress: CalCars Weighs In on GM Series/Toyota Parallel PHEV Debate<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
