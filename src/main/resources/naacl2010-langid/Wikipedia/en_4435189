'''Soft laser desorption''' is  desorption of large molecules that results in  without fragmentation. "Soft" in the context of  formation means forming ions without breaking s. "Hard" ionization is the formation of ions with the breaking of bonds and the formation of fragment ions. 
The term "soft laser desorption" has not been widely used by the  community, which in most cases uses  (MALDI) to indicate soft laser desorption ionization that is aided by a separate matrix compound. The term soft laser desorption was used most notably by the  in public information released in conjunction with the 2002 .<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2002: Information for the Public | date=9 October 2002 | publisher=The Nobel Foundation | url =http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2002/public.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-29 | language = }}</ref>  was awarded 1/4 of the prize for his use of a mixture of  s and  in what he called the “ultra fine metal plus liquid matrix method” of laser desorption ionization.
