In early July, the Swedish battlefleet of 15 ships of the line sailed into the Gulf of Finland. A hastily assembled Russian fleet of 17 ships of the line under Admiral  met the Swedish fleet off  Island on July 17, 1788.
The two fleets were fairly evenly matched, but while Greig was an experienced commander, Duke Karl seems to have spent much of the battle in his cabin. Duke Karl’s flagship was forced out of the line, shrouded in smoke. Greig’s flagship, the 100-gun ''Rostislav'' then attacked the 70-gun ''Prins Gustav'', commanded by Vice-Admiral Gustav Wachtmeister, which was forced to surrender. Elsewhere, the Swedes disabled the 74-gun ''Vladislav'', which lost its steering and was then surrounded by Swedish vessels before surrendering to the 62-gun ''Kronprins Gustav Adolf''. The fighting continued for six hours, and the fleets only separated after dark with the Swedish ships beginning to run out of ammunition.
