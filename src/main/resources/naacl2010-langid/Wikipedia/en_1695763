In , a relationship between two variables is '''negative''' if the  in a corresponding graph is negative, or&mdash;what is in some contexts equivalent&mdash;if the  between them is negative.
Example:
"They observed a negative relationship between illness and vaccination."
As incident of vaccination is increasing, incidence of illness is decreasing, and vice versa. 
Compare to a positive relationship:
Observed a positive relationship between illness and missed work. 
As incidence of illness increased, sick days taken also increased.
