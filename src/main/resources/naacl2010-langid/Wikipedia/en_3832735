''Fair use rationale''
This is a sound sample from a commercial recording. Its inclusion here is claimed as fair use because:
I believe that this use of the excerpt is in good faith, and that its inclusion does not reduce the commercial value of the recording from which it was drawn. +  01:07, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
