The '''Black Tom explosion''' of ,  in  was an act of sabotage on American ammunition supplies by  agents to prevent the materials from being used by the  in .
The term ''Black Tom'' originally referred to an island in  next to . The island received its name from a local legend of a "dark-skinned" resident named Tom. By 1880, a causeway and railway had been built connecting it to the mainland for use as a shipping depot. Sometime between 1905 and 1916, the , which owned the island and causeway, expanded the island with landfill, resulting in the addition of the entire area to the limits of Jersey City. The area contained a mile-long pier that housed the depot as well as warehouses for the National Dock and Storage Company. 
Black Tom was a major munitions depot for materials manufactured in the northeast. Prior to a 1915  of the  by the British , American industries were free to sell their materials to any buyer, but by this time the Allies were the only possible customers. It was reported that on the night of the attack, two million pounds of ammunition were being stored at the depot in freight cars, including one-hundred thousand pounds of TNT on the ''Johnson Barge No.17'', all awaiting eventual shipment to Britain and France. It was obviously a tempting target. Future mayor , then commissioner of public safety, reported that he had been told that the barge had been "tied up at Black Tom to avoid a twenty-five dollar towing charge."

After midnight, a series of small fires were found on the pier. Some guards fled, fearing an explosion; others attempted to fight the fires. Eventually they called the Jersey City Fire Department.
At 2:08 a.m., the first and biggest of the explosions took place. Shrapnel from the explosion travelled long distances, some lodging in the  and some in the clocktower of the  building in , over a mile away, stopping the clock at 2:12 a.m. The explosion was the equivalent of an earthquake measuring between 5.0 and 5.5 on the  [http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/liberty_state_park/liberty_blacktomexplosion.html *] and was felt as far away as . Windows broke as far as 25 miles (40 km) away, including thousands in lower . Some window panes in  were completely shattered. The outer wall of Jersey City's City Hall was cracked and the Brooklyn Bridge was shaken.

Property damage from the attack was estimated at $20 million ($377 million today). The damage to the Statue of Liberty was valued at $100,000 ($1.9 million today) and included the skirt and the torch.

Immigrants being processed at  also had to be evacuated to lower Manhattan. Reports vary, but as many as seven people may have been killed, including:

Two of the guards who had lit the smudge pots were immediately arrested. However, it soon became clear that the blast had not been an accident. It was traced to a Slovak immigrant named Michael Kristoff (probably a stolen identity), who had served in the U.S. Army, but admitted to carrying suitcases for the Germans before America entered . According to him, two of the guards were German agents. It is likely that the bombing involved some of the ingenious techniques developed by a group of German agents surrounding German ambassador Count , probably using the s developed by Captain .
Although blamed at the time solely on German agents, later investigations in the aftermath of the  unearthed links between the  and the Black Tom explosion.  is known to have also been involved in both. Later investigations by the Directorate of Naval Intelligence is known to have found extensive links to the Irish movement, the Indian Movement, as well as the Communist elements{{Fact|date=January 2008}}.<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite web
The Lehigh Valley Railroad Company sought damages against Germany under the  with the German-American Mixed Claims Commission. The commission in 1939 declared that Imperial Germany had been responsible and ordered damages. The two sides finally settled on $50 million in 1953. The final payment was made in 1979.
The location of Black Tom Island can be visited today as part of . The park consists of former industrial and railroad lands created by filling in the waters adjoining Black Tom to the north, making it now part of the mainland. The former Black Tom Island is the area at the end of Morris Pesin Drive in the southeastern corner of the park. A plaque marks the spot of the explosion.
The plaque reads
<blockquote>
'''Explosion at Liberty!'''<br />
On July 30, 1916 the Black Tom munitions depot exploded rocking New York Harbor and sending residents tumbling from their beds.<br />
The noise of the explosion was heard as far away as Maryland and Connecticut. On Ellis Island, terrified immigrants were evacuated by ferry to the Battery. Shrapnel pierced the Statue of Liberty (the arm of the Statue was closed to visitors after this). Property damage was estimated at $20 million. It is not known how many died.<br />
Why the explosion? Was it an accident or planned? According to historians, the Germans sabotaged the Lehigh Valley munitions depot in order to stop deliveries being made to the British who had blockaded the Germans in Europe.<br />
