'''Samo''' (died 658, ruled 623&ndash;658) was a  merchant from the "Senonian country" (''Senonago'') (probably modern , ).<ref>Fredegar says that "Samo [was] a Frank by birth [or nation] from the Senon[ag]ian province."</ref> He established himself as a ruler of the , establishing a supra-tribal union usually called   '''Samo's empire''', '''realm''', '''kingdom''', or '''tribal union'''. He is the first ruler over a  polity known by name.
The main source of written information on Samo and his empire is the '''', a Frankish chronicle written in the mid-seventh century (c. 660). Though theories of multiple authorship abounded once, the notion of a single "Fredegar" is common scholarly fare today.<ref name="Curta59">Curta, 59.</ref> The last or only Fredegar was the author of the brief account of the  in which is found the best, and only contemporary, information on Samo. 
All other sources for Samo are derived from Fredegar, and are much more recent. The ''Gesta Dagoberti I regnis Francorum'' ("Deeds of King Dagobert I of the Franks") was written in the first third of the . The ''Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum'' ("Conversion of the Bavarians and Carantanians") from  (the Bavarian ecclesiastic centre), written in 871&ndash;872, is a very tendentious source, as its name suggests. According mainly to the ''Conversio'', Samo was a Carantanian merchant. 
The sources "Fredegar" used to compile his Wendish account are unknown. A few scholars have attacked the entire account as fictitious, but Fredegar displays a critical attitude and a knowledge of detail that suggest otherwise.<ref name="Curta60">Curta, 60.</ref> It is possible that he had an eyewitness in the person of Sicharius, the ambassador of  to the Slavs.<ref name="Curta59"/> According to Fredegar, the "Wends" had long been subjects and ''befulci'' of the . ''Befulci'' was a word, cognative with the word ''fulcfree'' found in the , signifying "entrusted [to guard]", from the  root ''felhan, falh, fulgum'' and  ''bevelhen''.<ref name="Curta60"/> Fredegar appears to have envisaged the Wends as a military unit of the Avar host. He probably based his account on "native" Wendish accounts.<ref name="Curta60"/> Fredegar records the story of the ''origo gentis'' (origin of the people) of the Wends. The Wends were Slavs, but Samo was only king of the Wends, at least in Fredegar's eyes.<ref name="Curta60"/> 
It has also been suggested that Fredegar's sources may have been the reports of Christian missionaries, especially disciples of  and the .<ref name="Curta60"/> If this is the case, it may explain why he is remarkably free of typical stereotypes of heathen Slavs: he was familiar with the Wends as a specifically pagan nation.<ref name="Curta60"/>  
Samo's dates are based on Fredegar, who says that he went to the Slavs in the fortieth year of  (623&ndash;4) and reigned for thirty five years.<ref name="Curta109">Curta, 109.</ref> The interpretation of Fredegar which places the start of Samo's reign in the year of his arrival has been questioned on the basis that the Wends would have most likely rebelled after the defeat of the   at the  in 626.<ref name="Curta109"/> The Avars first arrived in the  and subdued the local Slavs in the 560s. Samo may have been one of the merchants who supplied arms to the Slavs for their regular revolts.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} Whether he became king during a revolt of 623&ndash;4 or during the one which inevitably followed the Avar defeat in 626, he definitely took advantage of the latter to solidify his position.<ref name="Curta109"/> A string of victories over the Avars proved his ''utilitas'' (usefulness) to his subjects and secured his election as ''rex'' (king).<ref>Curta, 330.</ref> Samo went on to secure his throne by marriage into the major Wendish families, wedding at least twelve women and fathering twenty-two sons and fifteen daughters.<ref name="Curta331">Curta, 331.</ref> 
The most famous event of Samo's career is his victory over Frankish royal army under  in 631 or 632. Provoked to action by a "violent quarrel in the Pannonian kingdom of the Avars or Huns" during his ninth year (631&ndash;2), Dagobert led three armies against the Wends, the largest being composed of ns under himself.<ref>Curta, 109 n102.</ref> The Franks were routed  near  ( ''castrum Wogastisburc''), an unidentified location meaning "fortress/castle of Vogast." In the aftermath of the Wendish victory, the  prince  abandoned the Franks and "placed himself and his people under Samo" (Fredegar).<ref name="Curta331n39">Curta, 331 n39.</ref> Samo even invaded Frankish  several times and undertook looting raids there.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} 
In 641 the rebellious , , sought an alliance with Samo against his sovereign, .<ref name="Curta109"/> Samo also maintained long-distance trade relationships.<ref name="Curta331"/> On his death, however, his title was not inherited by his sons.<ref name="Curta331n39"/> Ultimately, Samo can be credited with forging a Wendish identity by speaking on behalf of the community which recognised his authority.<ref>Curta, 343.</ref> 
Archaeological findings indicate that the "empire" was situated in present-day , ,  and . The settlements of the later Moravian and  principalities (see ) are often identical with those from the time of Samo's Empire. Present-day  probably,  at the  surely, and state of  temporarily, became parts of the empire later (in the 630s), as well. Although the Slavs, led by King Samo, managed to defeat all Avar attacks, Slav conflicts with Frankish merchants, in which merchants were killed and goods stolen, forced them to fight against the Franks as well. 
The history of the empire after Samo's death in 658 or 659 is largely unclear. It is generally assumed that it disappeared with Samo's death. Archaeological findings show that the Avars returned to their previous territories (at least to southernmost part of present-day Slovakia) and entered into a symbiosis with the Slavs, whereas territories to the north of the Avar empire were purely Slav territories. The first specific thing that is known about the fate of these Slavs and Avars, is the existence of the Moravian and Nitrian principalities in the late eighth century which were attacking the Avars, and the defeat of the Avars by the Franks under  in 799 or 802&ndash;3, after which the Avars quickly ceased to exist.
