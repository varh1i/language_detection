<!-- <ref name="FairfaxParish_note">The original text of the agreement describes the boundary as running "from the mouth of Little Hunting Creek up the same to the forks thereof; thence up the meanders of the South branch thereof to the Gum Spring thereon; from thence by a straight line to the ford of Dogue run where the back road from Colchester crosses the said run and from thence by a straight line to the forks of Difficult [run]."  The "meanders of the South branch" probably correspond to what is now known as the North Branch as it runs up into the Gum Springs community past its fork with the Paul Spring Branch.</ref> -->
In 1929, a bridge was designed as a part of the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway, which was completed in 1931.  The bridge was not part of the original plans for the highway - other creeks were successfully filled in with soil to cut costs; but the Little Hunting could not be filled in, because the soil in the creek bed was very unstable.<ref name="LHC_bridge"/>
In modern times, residential communities began to spring up on both sides of the creek by the 1960s.<ref name="WaPo_Wessynton_11Nov2006">
