This is being listed for deletion as a part of the project to cleanup UAV-related articles. This particular article is a hoax, neither source link has any information, and the only Ghit references are to UFO and military conspiracy forums. There is no documentation that this aircraft has ever existed. '''Delete'''  18:25, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
