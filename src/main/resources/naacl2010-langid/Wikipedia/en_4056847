The image linked to  is claimed to be used under fair use as:
   1. it is a logo of a predecessor to a widely-known government entity;
   2. the image is no longer in common use, so its use here as a descriptive historical tool does not adversely impact the copyright holder;
   3. the logo is only being used to identify the government entity;
   4. its inclusion in the article adds significantly to the article because it represents the history of the subject of this article.
The image, along with the content of the web site, is ''Copyright City of Denton, Texas.''
