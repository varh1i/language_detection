The {{nihongo|'''Tachikawa Ki-9'''|九五式一型練習機|Kyūgo-shiki ichigata renshuki}} was an intermediate  of the  built by  in the 1930s. It was known to the  under the code name of '''''Spruce''''' during .
The Ki-9 was a two seat unequal wing  design. Tachikawa originally planned to use the same basic  for both basic training and intermediate training, differentiating the two models by the use of different engines.
The prototype Ki-9 flew on  , powered by a {{Convert|261|kW|hp|-1|abbr=on}} a radial engine. The second prototype was identical, and the third prototype was powered by a {{Convert|112|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}}  seven-cylinder radial engine. The third prototype exhibited stability problems due a  issue, and as a result the primary trainer model was abandoned and the Ki-9 was developed only for the intermediate trainer. Tachikawa subsequently developed the  for the primary trainer role. The first production aircraft were delivered in 1935.
The Ki-9 was introduced to service as the Army Type 95-1 Medium Grade Trainer Model A under the former aircraft naming nomenclature system. The first version had a complex split-axle  with fairings over the top of the wheels. In 1939 this was modified and simplified, the fuselage slightly shortened and total weight reduced. The resulting Army Type 95-1 Model B or Ki-9-kai had improved maneuverability and flight characteristics. This version was quickly superseded by the Army Type 95-1 Model C, or Ki-9-otsu in full production.
Both versions were used widely for blind-flying training with a folding hood over the rear cockpit, and several were modified with a glazed canopy over the rear cockpit for use as a staff officer transport plane.
Production by Tachikawa totaled 2,395 aircraft, ending in 1942. At least another 220 Ki-9s were constructed by  from 1943-1945.
The Ki-9 was also flown in wartime by Japanese satellite countries and postwar by the fledgling government of , and captured units by the .
