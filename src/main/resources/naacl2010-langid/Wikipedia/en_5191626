The '''Tweed'''  were  made in  covering. The tweed was first used on Fender amps in 1948. The Fender company stopped using the tweed covering on all amplifiers, except the , in 1960. Fender last used the tweed on the Champ in 1964. The tweed covering was also used on Fender's guitar cases in the 1950s.<ref>Fender Amps:The First 50 Years</ref>
This era is distinct not just for the covering, but also the construction of the amplifiers: the chassis are mounted to the back with the tubes pointed down, as oppose to having the chassis mounted on the top of cabinet.  This has the benefit of providing  ease of access to the inside while providing a strong top.
At the beginning of tweed era Fender construct its cabinet in "wide panel", where the top and bottom panel is wider than the side. Fender later on construct it with "narrow panel", in which all the panels have more or less the same width. Toward the end, despite keeping such construction, Fender utlize tolex to cover its amp.
Aside from reissues and Customs series, Fender's Hot Rod series is the only line that use such construction.
