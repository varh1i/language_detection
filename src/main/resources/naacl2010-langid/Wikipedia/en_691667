On November 10, 1950, a B-50 returning one of several US Mark 4 nuclear bombs secretly deployed in Canada had engine trouble and jettisoned a weapon at 10,500 feet (3,200 m). The bomb, carrying the depleted uranium tamper but not its plutonium core ("pit"), was set to self-destruct at 2500' (750 m) and dropped over the St. Lawrence River off Rivière du Loup, Québec. The explosion shook area residents and scattered nearly 100 pounds (45 kg) of depleted uranium.
