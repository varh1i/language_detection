In November 2004, Martinez was the Republican nominee in the  to replace retiring Democrat . Much of Martinez's support came from Washington: he was endorsed early by many prominent Republican groups, and publicly supported by key national Republican figures such as Senate Majority Leader . His Cuban background and his popularity in the battleground Orlando, Florida region both contributed to his appeal to the statewide GOP in Florida. But Internet magazine  reported that Martinez wanted to run for governor in , though the GOP convinced him to run for Senate two years earlier instead. 
Martinez's nomination by the Republican Party was far from certain. He was seriously challenged by former Congressman . McCollum criticized Martinez's background as a plaintiff's attorney, and many Republicans initially feared that Martinez's nomination would destroy the GOP's ability to criticize Democratic vice presidential nominee ' background. Martinez was also said to be soft on , a major Republican issue in the 2004 race.
After a McCollum surge in the final weeks leading up to the primary, Martinez fought back in the last week of the race, putting out mass mailings and television ads that called McCollum "the new darling of homosexual extremists," pointing out that McCollum had sponsored hate crimes legislation while a member of the House of Representatives.  Martinez pulled some of the more offensive ads from the air after a personal appeal from  , but never disavowed them.   The '''' took the extraordinary step of revoking its endorsement of Martinez in the Republican primary and endorsing McCollum.<ref>[http://www.sptimes.com/2004/08/30/Opinion/McCollum_for_GOP.shtml McCollum for GOP].  Editorial by , August 30, 2004.</ref>

Martinez defeated his Democratic opponent, , in a very close election that was preceded by numerous negative television ads from both campaigns. Martinez's margin of victory was small enough that a winner was not declared until Castor conceded the day after the election.
President Bush won in Florida by 52%-47%, but Martinez only won 49%-48%, with a margin of about 70,000 votes. Martinez did much worse than Bush in the Tampa area, such as in  and  counties, and in smaller counties such as Liberty and Lafayette.

In August 2006, the Martinez campaign acknowledged that the 2004 campaign had been under review by the  for more than a year. Following the 2004 election, Martinez originally reported that his $12-million campaign had about $115,000 in debt, according to FEC documents. But the latest revision of that figure shows the original tally was off by about a half-million dollars: his campaign instead owed $685,000 in election expenses.
The FEC has sent Martinez at least 20 letters asking to clarify his 2004 campaign reports. His campaign has spent about $300,000 in accounting and attorney's fees since the 2004 election (see [http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/elections/orl-bk-martinez081106,0,727948.story?coll=orl-home-headlines]

An amended complaint by CREW in October 2006 alleged similar behavior by Bacardi for Democratic Senator 's 2006 re-election campaign. <ref>[http://www.citizensforethics.org/press/newsrelease.php?view=171 CREW FILES AMENDED FEC COMPLAINT AGAINST BACARDI USA AND MARTINEZ FOR SENATE]</ref>
Despite an absence of a quorum, the Senate approved The , formally known as the Act for the relief of the parents of Theresa Marie Schiavo (S. 686 CPS), in the early hours of March 20, 2005, to allow the case of Terri Schiavo to be moved into a federal court. The bill passed unanimously by voice vote and no formal record of the vote was made.  (R-TN),  (R-PA), and Mel Martinez (R-FL),the only Senators present, voted for the bill with the remaining 97 Senators not present. 
The act was strongly criticized by many on both sides of the political divide for the following reasons.
 
As in the state courts, all of the Schindlers' federal petitions on behalf of Mrs.Schiavo and appeals were denied, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to grant , effectively ending the Schindler family legal options.

Martinez immediately denied all knowledge of Darling's involvement in the situation, noting that he himself had inadvertently passed a copy of the memo to  Senator  of , believing that it was nothing more than an outline of the Republican proposal. Martinez asserted that the memo "was intended to be a working draft," stating that Darling "doesn't really know how I got it." 
The Schiavo memo is the third incident in which Martinez accepted broad responsibility while laying blame upon a staffer for the underlying deed. During the Republican primary, a staffer was blamed for a passage in a campaign flyer painting his opponent  as a servant of the "radical homosexual lobby". Shortly thereafter another staffer was blamed for labeling federal agents involved in the  affair as "armed thugs" <ref>[http://www.sptimes.com/2005/04/08/Worldandnation/New_gaffe__old_Martin.shtml New gaffe, old Martinez defense]</ref>.
In spite of Martinez's vocal objections to homosexual issues such as gay marriage, he employed two gay men in his  Senate campaign <ref>[http://www.washblade.com/2004/7-16/news/breaking/two.cfm Anti-gay Senate candidate has two gay advisers]</ref>. One of them, , would become a figure in the  scandal.
In November 2006, Martinez was named general chairman of the  for the 2007–2008 election cycle ( will handle the day-to-day operations). Some felt the choice was made in part due to the dip in support for Republicans among Latino voters in the 2006 midterm elections. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/cq/2006/11/14/cq_1937.html Republicans Poised to Tap Martinez to Shape Message in Advance of 2008 Race ]</ref> Some conservatives objected to Martinez's selection, citing his positions on immigration and their general lack of enthusiasm for his performance as senator.  Martinez stepped down from this position on October 19, 2007.
<blockquote>"The bottom line is I don't plan on prosecuting anyone. When I go to the United States Senate, I'm going to be confirming judges who will go to the courts, and the courts will deal with the issue. This is not up for a vote by the United States Senate."
