It has a 18-hole Championship golf course designed by world renowned golfer and course designed Greg Norman.<br />The resort also boasts a $5 million clubhouse, as well as a fitness center and 44 Grand Mecure apartments. The resort is owned by American entrepenuer Don Panoz and Australian business manager John Stevens. Don owns other golf resorts in the US such as the Chateu Elan, and the Diablo Grande.<br />The Vintage is home to the NSW Open the closing golf tournament of the Von Nida Tour. The Vintage has signed on for 5 years with the NSWGA to host the event which proved to be a huge success in 2007 with both fans and Professionals.
Don Panoz brought with him to The Vintage, a vison of expansion and growth for the resort. The plans include a Day Spa to be completed by early 2009, a hotel and outdoor entertainment arena as well as another 9 hole golf course. Unfortunately the Day Spa hasn't yet been approved by council and as a result it looks as though the deadline of early 2009 isn't realistic.
The NSW Open was held for the first time at The Vintage in 2007, with a new innovative form, whereby a pro-am event is played on the weekend as well as the final two days of the tournament. The prizemoney in 2007 was $115,000 (AU) and the tournament attracted some big names in Australian golf such as, US PGA Tour players Jarrod Lyle and Nick Flanagan, as well as Tennis player turned Golf pro Scott Draper, and successful Golfer James Nitties.
In 2008 the tournament looks to grow in size and stature as the week it is on does not hold the HSBC Champions tournament as it did last year. Organisers plan for a rise in prize money as well as a star studded line up of Australian golfers, for the prestigious closing event of the Von Nida Tour.
