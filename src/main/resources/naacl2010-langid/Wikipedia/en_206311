'''Civil aviation''' is one of two major categories of flying, representing all non-, both private and commercial.  Most of the countries in the world are members of the  (ICAO) and work together to establish common standards and recommended practices for civil aviation through that agency.
Civil aviation includes two major categories:
Although scheduled air transport is the larger operation in terms of passenger numbers, GA is larger in the number of flights (and flight hours, in the U.S.[http://www.ntsb.gov/aviation/Table1.htm]) In the U.S., GA carries 166 million passengers each year,[http://www.gaservingamerica.com/Advantages_of_GA.htm] more than any individual airline, though less than all the airlines combined.
Most countries also make a regulatory distinction based on whether aircraft are flown for hire:
All scheduled air transport is commercial, but general aviation can be either commercial or private.  Normally, the pilot, aircraft, and operator must all be authorized to perform commercial operations through separate commercial licensing, registration, and operation certificates.
The  (the ''Chicago Convention'') was originally established in 1944: it states that signatories should collectively work to harmonize and standardize the use of airspace for safety, efficiency and regularity of air transport.[http://www.icao.int/icaonet/dcs/7300.html] All the States signatory to the Chicago Convention, now 188, are obliged to implement the Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) of the Convention.
Each signatory country has a  (CAA) (such as the  in the United States) to oversee the following areas of civil aviation:
