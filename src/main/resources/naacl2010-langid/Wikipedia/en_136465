'''Iveland''' is a  in the  of , .
The old municipality of  was split January 1, 1886.
It is bordered in the northwest by , in the northeast and east by , and in the south and west by . The municipality has three population centers: ,  and . 
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old farm Iveland ( ''Ífuland''), since the first church was built there. The first element is the genitive case of the rivername ''Ífa'' (now ), the last element is ''land'' n 'land; farm'. The old rivername is probably derived from the Norse word ''ýr'' m 'yew' ().

Iveland is the smallest municipality in .  The  river which flows through Iveland is the largest river in the  district. Towards the east it borders on lake Oggevatn. 
The Iveland area includes several hundred old mines.  These pegmatite mines and quarries yield more than 100 different minerals, including minerals containing s, , ,  and .
Although nothing is found in written sources about Iveland before the 15th century, there is evidence of occupation for thousands of years prior to that.  implements have been found which are four-five thousand years old.  A King’s road (''Kongevegen '' in Norwegian) which allowed for horse travel went in an east-west direction through the area and was in use as early as the 9th century, and perhaps before. But the first written record of farms created by clearing the land goes back 600 years.
The  (''Setesdalsbanen'' in Norwegian) was a  steam railway which went across Iveland on its route between  and Byglandsfjord in Bygland. It was built in 1896. Setesdalsbanen operation was terminated in  and the track was removed between Byglandsfjord and Beihølen.  When it was constructed, it revived the lumber industry. Large quantities of planks, poles and timbers were brought by horse to the Iveland station and forwarded by railroad to Kristiansand. This resulted in better prices since it provided competition with the floated timber.
