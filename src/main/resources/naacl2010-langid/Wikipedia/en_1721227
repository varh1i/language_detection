This course is frequently criticised, even by native speakers of Irish. It has been criticised for its alleged "presumptuous attitude". This is a problem in that teachers rarely teach the basic elements of the language, such as  or verb conjugations, assuming they are already known. However, as the course for primary schools is not examined this may not always be the case. The most common argument is the entire way in which it is taught, with a large number of people (including teachers) believing the course should be much closer to that of the French and German course.
Irish is also under debate as to whether it should remain mandatory in the Irish curriculum. Currently, most  in Ireland will only accept students with a pass grade in the Irish . Arguments for this motion contend that forcing the language on students fosters dislike, producing a generation of Irish people who dislike their culture. Making it optional, the argument goes, would mean students would enjoy the language more and teachers would be of higher quality. In opposition however, it is claimed that the language is a part of Irish heritage and culture, which needs to be preserved.
