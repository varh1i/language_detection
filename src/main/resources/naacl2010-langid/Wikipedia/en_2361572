This image is based on a screen capture of  found in wikimedia commons.  I have made a miniaturized version via screen capture in order to be able to use it as an icon to denote audible content when linking to a song.  The copyright tag on the original file is public domain, i.e. "This file has been released into the public domain by the copyright holder, its copyright has expired, or it is ineligible for copyright. This applies worldwide."  To the extent that my modified version of it may be considered a different file, I, Polaris999, do hereby specifically release it into the public domain also.
