The company was founded in the 1990s by Mario Moretti Polegato. The brand name, Geox, comes from a mixture between the Greek word “geo” (earth, on which we all walk), and “x”, a letter-element symbolizing technology. 
Polegato was born in 1953 near . Originally destined to take over the family wine-making business, legend has it the idea for the shoe came while at a wine industry conference. His feet were very hot while out jogging so he had the idea to cut a couple of holes in the sole of his shoes.
He developed the idea into a viable product with the help of a small leather-goods business his family owned.
Discovering that there was not much interest in his idea within the established shoemaking industry, Polegato established his own company to design, develop and manufacture the shoes.
Geox is headquartered in Italy. Its shoes are manufactured in Romania, China, Vietnam, Indonesia and Brazil.
