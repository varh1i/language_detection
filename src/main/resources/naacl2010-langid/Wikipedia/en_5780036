This is a screenshot of the character "Chomper", taken from the episode "The Star Day Celebration". It was originally uploaded under the file name "Image:Chomper.jpg". Then the image got deleted because it lacked a fair use rationale. I asked User:Maxim, who had deleted the image, as well as Image:Ruby.jpg, to restore both images so I could fix them. While Ruby's image was restored and fixed, Chomper's image had a major problem. It wasn't the same image as I remembered. So I just left it to site there, though I contacted all of the users reputed to have uploaded the file various times before, but nothing seemed to help. Just as it seemed the image I had wanted restored - the ''right'' image of Chomper's article - would never be recovered, I noticed the bot which tags orphaned images and files had tagged it, and out of curiosity, I went there. There it was! Apparently another user had reuploaded it with the right image! Oh! Now all the right images of the characters could be restored at long last! Because in that time, I had uploaded a temporary go-by image of Chomper so readers could still identify him, I saved the image to my hard drive and reuploaded it to this file instead. (Always support your family over others). Anyway, but this one already has a fair use rationale in it, so I only have to look it over and make sure it's properly detailed.
It is believed that this image qualifies under fair use in  for the following reasons:
