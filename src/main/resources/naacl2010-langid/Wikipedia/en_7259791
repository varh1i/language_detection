'''Doron 'Lyrebird' Burd (July 12 1989 - )'''
Doron Burd, born July 12 1989 in Melbourne Australia, is a well known storyteller and comedian within the underground Melbourne comedy community. He is particularly popular amongst the Melbourne Jewish Youth following acheiving local fame and international acclaim due to his participation in the 2006 Jewish Breakdancing World Championships, which provided him with the base from which to launch his successful comedy career.
Doron's material is largely based upon his extensive life experiences and while new audience members may struggle to comprehend the intricacies of Burd's life, the underlying truth of his message is evident to his frequent viewers and longtime fans. Burd thrilled audiences in 2008 with his partnership with notable Israeli television personality Captain Shy Hacham, delighting audiences and resulting in sellout crowds.
Despite his fame, controversy has recently arisen regarding the connections between the popular entertainer and notable juvenile ex-convict youth gangs involving possible death threats and mysterious disappearances following the appearance of a bright yellow van. 
Burd's business ventures and commercial success threatened to supersede his comedy career in early 2008 as his rising position in Coles Australia dominated his night hours, the only time he spent awake and could practice his act. However, following being threatened at gunpoint and waking up on various Israeli beaches simultaneously, Doron realised that his true passion and future lied in the realm of comedy, allowing him to draw from these experiences to create his new tour 'The Call of the Lyrebird (UNCUT)'.
In a recent interview Doron expressed his desire to become a clinical psychologist specialising in compulsive lying and his undying love for the food of his longtime squeeze.
