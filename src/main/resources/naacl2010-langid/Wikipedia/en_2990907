Article seems to promote an online game. From the article: "As of June 2006, the game had over 1300 coaches [i.e. players], each with his own virtual club. The game is completely ficticious and players are randomly generated when clubs are created. Ontheball is in its 6th season and has been running since 25 November 2002. The game is currently still under development and continues to be badged as being Beta until the game is stable." These claims don't impress me very much; in addition; the game's website has [http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ontheball.com.au%2F no Alexa rank]. My judgement is: no evidence of notability, <b>delete</b>. -  11:41, 30 July 2006 (UTC)
