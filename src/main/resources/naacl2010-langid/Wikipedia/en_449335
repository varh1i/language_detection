Thorpe Park is situated on what was a quarry in Staines, up until the late 1970s. Former owners Ready Mix Concrete filled the site with water after the quarry's closure, with the intent to start a leisure park.<ref name='about us'>{{cite web |url=http://www.thorpepark-jobs.com/about_us/more/ |title=More about Thorpe Park - Three decades of thrills |accessdate=2007-08-28}}</ref> On , , Thorpe Park was officially opened by  who lent his name to the Mountbatten Pavilion, a large domed structure located at the entrance to the park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chertseylocal.co.uk/History/P11ChertseyHistoryModernTimes.php |title=A History of Chertsey - Modern Times |accessdate=2007-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thorpeparkinsider.co.uk/history/story.php |title=The History of Thorpe Park |accessdate=2007-08-28}}</ref> At this early stage in the park's history, the complex consisted of educational exhibitions such as ''Model World'', a collection of famous structures from around the world built in 1:36 scale, with the Mountbatten Pavilion housing a standing aircraft display.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thorpeparkguide.com/features/historytp/index.html |title=A restoration success story |accessdate=2007-08-28}}</ref>

Thorpe Park is split up into eight distinctly themed areas.
Known more commonly as "The Dome", Port Atlantis has a marine theme. This building contains such essentials as guest services, shops, toilets, lockers, a bar and staff areas. It includes a large restaurant called 'The Glasshouse'. When the park initially opened this was known as the Mountbatten Pavilion.
Lost City is the largest area in Thorpe Park, hosting the majority of the rides in the park. It is based around a Mayan temple/land.
Calypso Quay is home to:
Themed around a  creek, this area is home to:
During the Fright Nights around , Canada Creek also becomes home to the "Hellgate" horror maze (previously Freakshow 3-D).
Themed around a 1950s New-Hampshire fishing village devastated by a tidal wave. It has its own park radio station, WWTP radio, hosted by 'Big Bob'. The rides in this area include:
Ranger County is themed around the "Thorpe Park Rangers" mascots. The current rides consist of:
"The Showcase" is currently featuring on the Ranger County stage. This was once home to shows featuring the Thorpe Park Rangers, since then the Showcase has been used for karaoke and is currently showing the "Top Rockers" show during busy periods.
The area also contains "Calypso BBQ and Bar", a covered outdoor BBQ restaurant and "Jumpin' Juices" which sells fresh fruit juices.
During the Fright Nights events in October, Ranger County also contains a themed maze, which has been known as "The Asylum" since 2005. This enters through a door at the back of "The Showcase", with the queue line starting at Miss Hippo's Fungle Safari and using the queueline for the ride (the ride closes early), continuing through the ride exit for Fungle Safari and then entering a cattle grid which goes through The Showcase. The attraction exit is located just to the right of The Showcase.
Themed around the mythical Neptune, this area is home to:
Located in the area between Port Atlantis, Amity Cove and X:\No Way Out. Octopus Garden is a small aquatic-themed area with several small rides for very young children. There are seven rides:
Each ride has a maximum height restriction of 1.3m, the only ride which has a special exception is Slippery Serpent where a guest over 1.3m can accompany one under 1.3m.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thorpepark.com/explore_the_park/height_guide.asp?css=2 |title= Explore the Park: Height Guide |accessdate=2007-08-28}}</ref>
All rides are usually open, although there are usually fewer operators in the area than rides available and so the operators rotate around the rides when they are available to do so.
The area also has a Donuts shop and an entrance to Thorpe Mega Store.
Fastrack is the current name for a priority queuing system in place at Thorpe Park as well as other Merlin parks. The system used to be based on the idea of assigning guests a time to ride a particular attraction and allowing them to skip the queue. The system has worked in a number of ways at the park and under a number of different names.
The first such system to be introduced, which was trialled for three seasons, was the Q-Bot system which emerged in the 1990s and attracted attention from  programme . This system gave guests a pager-like device which beeped when it was their slot on a particular ride.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lo-q.com/press/Amusement%20Business%20March%202001.htm |title=Six Flags Debuts Queue Management |accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref>
The Virtual Q system emerged in 2000 and worked by using a number of machines by the entrance to a ride where guests would scan their park tickets and received a printed out a ticket with a time to ride the particular ride. The system was renamed "Fastrack" in 2003 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thorpeparkguide.com/parktour/calypsoquay/photos/nemesis5.jpg |title= Picture of Nemesis Inferno's entrance showing Fastrack ticket machines in operation |accessdate=2007-09-02}}</ref>. The system is currently not in use at Thorpe Park.
The current system is based on the "4Play" ticket which was introduced in 2004 as an adjunct to the ticket machine issued Fastrack tickets. The ticket allowed guests to pay £4 and get a non time limited ticket for one Fastrack ride on Colossus, Nemesis Inferno, Tidal Wave and Logger's Leap. The range of rides that Fastrack is offered on has since been extended. In 2006 and 2007, tickets are usually purchased in a package of four rides (although there is an option to buy an individual ticket for one ride on any Fastrack participating ride except Stealth). The current packages available are:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thorpepark.com/tickets/ticket_prices.asp?css=2 |title=Tickets: Ticket Prices |accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref>
As another way of aiming to reduce guests' queuing times, Thorpe Park also operates single rider queue lines as an adjunct to Fastrack. Single Rider is available on Stealth, almost every day, and also on Flying Fish on busy days. The system allows people who don't mind riding alone another way to queue in a separate queue line. If a single spare seat becomes available, then a single rider would be admitted, potentially reducing the queue time <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themeparkjunkies.co.uk/index.php?act=parkguide&pip=8&park=2 |title=Single Rider |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref>. Riders are informed that the single rider queue may be as long as the main queue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themeparkreview.com/miniuk2006/thorpe41.jpg|title=Stealth Single Rider Entrance, from Theme Park Review|accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref>
Thorpe Park has held, and still continues to hold, a number of records for its rides. These include:
''Fright Nights'' have been running at Thorpe Park since 2002 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://hauntedattractions.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=63&Itemid=74 |title=Haunted Attractions UK - Thorpe Park Fright Nights... an EVILution! |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref>. For a period during October the park opens until 8pm on off peak days and 10pm on peak days (11pm in 2003) to allow guests to ride the rides in the dark along with some additional attractions. Some of the extra attractions that have featured over the years are:
(These three attractions have a 12 year old age restriction.)

The upcoming ride will be located in the Canada Creek area of the park and the queue line will be located on the new island which has been created in Abbey lake next to the Samurai entrance and a new path is being created via the walkway under Colossus's inline twists. The ride is expected to include a 100ft 97 degree drop, 2 s including a dive loop.
The layout was revised in May 08, the third inversion was removed and replaced with an airtime hill<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thorpeparkguide.com/2009/|title=The Thorpe Park Guide 2009 New Coaster |accessdate=2008-02-07}}</ref>
