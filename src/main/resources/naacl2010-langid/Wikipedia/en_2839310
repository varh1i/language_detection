'''Structural dynamics''' is a subset of  which covers the behaviour of s subjected to  loading. Dynamic loads include people, wind, waves, traffic, s, and blasts. Any structure can be subject to dynamic loading. Dynamic analysis can be used to find dynamic , time history, and .
A  load is one which does not vary.  A dynamic load is one which changes with time. If it changes slowly, the structure's response may be determined with static analysis, but if it varies quickly (relative to the structure's ability to respond), the response must be determined with a dynamic analysis.
Dynamic analysis for simple structures can be carried out manually, but for complex structures  can be used to calculate the mode shapes and frequencies.
A dynamic load can have a significantly larger effect than a static load of the same magnitude due to the structure's inability to respond quickly to the loading (by deflecting). The increase in the effect of a dynamic load is given by the  (DAF):
where u is the deflection of the structure due to the load.
Graphs of dynamic amplification factors vs non-dimensional  (t<sub>r</sub>/T) exist for standard loading functions (for an explanation of rise time, see '''time history analysis''' below). Hence the DAF for a given loading can be read from the graph, the static deflection can be easily calculated for simple structures and the dynamic deflection found.
A full time history will give the response of a structure over time during and after the application of a load. To find the full time history of a structure's response you must solve the structure's .
A simple single   (a , M, on a  of , k for example) has the following equation of motion:
where <math>\ddot{x}</math> is the acceleration (the double  of the displacement) and x is the displacement.
If the loading F(t) is  a  (the sudden application of a constant load), the solution to the equation of motion is:
where ω = <math>\sqrt{\frac{{k}}{{M}}}</math> and the fundamental natural frequency, <math>f = \frac{{w}}{{2\pi}}</math>.
The static deflection of a single degree of freedom system is:
so you can write, by combining the above formulae:
This gives the (theoretical) time history of the structure due to a load F(t), where the false assumption is made that there is no .
Although this is too simplistic to apply to a real structure, the Heaviside Step Function is a reasonable model for the application of many real loads, such as the sudden addition of a piece of furniture, or the removal of a prop to a newly cast concrete floor.  However, in reality loads are never applied instantaneously - they build up over a period of time (this may be very short indeed).  This time is called the .
As the number of degrees of freedom of a structure increases it very quickly becomes too difficult to calculate the time history manually - real structures are analysed using   software.
Any real structure will dissipate energy (mainly through friction). This can be modelled by modifying the DAF:
where <math>c=\frac{{\text {Damping Coefficient}}}{{\text{Critical Damping Coefficient}}}</math> and is typically 2%-10% depending on the type of construction:
Generally damping would be ignored for transient events (for example, an  load such as a bomb blast), but would be important for non-transient events (such as wind loading or crowd loading).
A  calculates the frequency  or natural frequencies of a given system, but not necessarily its full time history response to a given input.  The natural frequency of a system is dependent only on the  of the structure and the  which participates with the structure (including self-weight). It is not dependent on the load function.
It is useful to know the modal frequencies of a structure as it allows you to ensure that the frequency of any applied periodic loading will not coincide with a modal frequency and hence cause , which leads to large .
The method is:
a) Find the natural modes (the shape adopted by a structure) and natural frequencies
b) Calculate the response of each mode
c) Optionally superpose the response of each mode to find the full modal response to a given loading
It is possible to calculate the frequency of different mode shapes of system manually by the . For a given mode shape of a multiple degree of freedom system you can find an "equivalent" mass, stiffness and applied force for a single degree of freedom system. For simple structures the basic mode shapes can be found by inspection, but it is not a conservative method. Rayleigh's principle states:
"The frequency ω of an arbitrary mode of vibration, calculated by the energy method, is always greater than - or equal to - the fundamental frequency ω<sub>n</sub>."
For an assumed mode shape <math>\bar{u}(x)</math>, of a structural system with mass, M; stiffness, EI (, E, multiplied by the , I); and applied force, F(x):
then, as above:
The complete modal response to a given load F(x,t) is <math>v(x,t)=\sum{u_n(x,t)}</math>. The summation can be carried out by one of three common methods:
To superpose the individual modal responses manually, having calculated them by the energy method:
Assuming that the rise time t<sub>r</sub> is known it is possible to read the DAF from a standard graph. The static displacement can be calculated with <math>u_{static}=\frac{F_{1,eq}}{k_{1,eq}}</math>. The dynamic displacement for the chosen mode and applied force can then be found from:
For real systems there is often mass participating in the  (such as the mass of ground in an ) and mass participating in  effects (the mass of the structure itself, M<sub>eq</sub>).  The  Γ is a comparison of these two masses.  For a single degree of freedom system Γ = 1.
