'''Fondue''' is a  communal dish shared at the table in an  pot ('''') over a small burner (''rechaud''). The term is derived from the French ''fondre'' (''to melt''), in the past tense ''fondu'' (''melted'').
Diners use forks to dip bits of food (most often bread) into the warm semi-liquid  (commonly a cheese mix). Heat is supplied by a  or gel , or a .
While cheese fondue is the most widely known, there are other pot and dipping ingredients. 
A recipe for a sauce made from  , grated  and white  appears in Scroll 11 (lines 629-645) of 's '''' and has been cited as the earliest record of a fondue.  communal fondue arose many centuries ago{{Fact|date=July 2008}} as a result of  methods. The Swiss   and -like  made in summer and fall were meant to last throughout the winter months. The bread aged, dried out and became so tough it was sometimes chopped with an ax. The stored cheese also became very hard, but when mixed with wine and heated it softened into a thick sauce. During Switzerland's long, cold winters some families and extended groups would gather about a large pot of cheese set over the fire and dip wood-hard bits of bread which quickly became edible.<ref>Fonduecity.com, ''[http://www.fonduecity.com/fonduehistory.htm Fondue History]'', retrieved 9 November 2007</ref>
Modern fondue originated during the 18th century in the  of . As Switzerland industrialized, wine and cheese producers encouraged the dish's popularity. By the 20th century many Swiss cantons and even towns had their own local varieties and recipes based on locally available cheeses, wines and other ingredients. During the 1950s a slowing cheese industry in Switzerland widely promoted fondue since one person could easily eat half a pound of melted cheese in one sitting. In 1955 the first pre-mixed "instant" fondue was brought to market. Fondue became very popular in the  during the mid-1960s after American tourists discovered it in Switzerland.

There are many kinds of fondue, each made with a different blend of cheeses, wine and seasoning, mostly depending on where it is made. The ''caquelon'' is first rubbed with a cut  clove, then wine and cheese slowly added until melted. A small amount of potato starch (or ,  or ) is added to prevent separation and the fondue is almost always further diluted with either , , , and/or . The most common recipe calls for 1  (100 ) of dry white wine per person and a 200  mix of hard (such as ) and semi-hard (such as ,  or ) cheeses: The mixture must be stirred continuously as it heats in the ''caquelon''. Crusty  is cut into cubes which are then speared on a fondue  and dipped into the melted cheese.
A cheese fondue mixture should be held at a  warm enough to keep the fondue smooth and liquid but not so hot as to allow any burning. If this temperature is held until the fondue is finished there will be a thin crust of toasted (not burnt) cheese at the bottom of the ''caquelon''. This is called ''la religieuse'' (French for ''the nun'', more or less). It has the texture of a thin  and is almost always lifted out and eaten.
Refrigerated fondue blends are sold in most Swiss supermarkets and need little more than melting in the caquelon. Individual portions heatable in a  are also sold.
Dessert fondue recipes began appearing in the 1960s. Slices of  or  are dipped in a caquelon of melted . Other dessert fondues can include , ,  and .
As with other communal dishes fondue has an  which can be both helpful and fun. Most often, allowing one's tongue or lips to touch the dipping fork will be thought of as rude. With meat fondues one should use a dinner fork to take meat off the dipping fork. A "no " rule also has sway: After a dipped morsel has been tasted it should never be returned to the pot. In longstanding Swiss tradition if a nugget of bread is lost in the cheese by a man he buys a bottle of wine and if such a thing happens to befall a woman she kisses the man on her left.<ref>[http://www.gofondue.com/fondue_101.htm Fondue 101 Guide<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.digsmagazine.com/host/host_fondue4.htm DigsMagazine.com | how         to have a fondue party]</ref> Lately, rather more humorous twists on this have shown up in Switzerland such as young diners diving into the snow whilst clad only in underwear.<!-- This one indeed happens and was shown in an ad on Swiss Television SF1 -->
In Switzerland sometimes children fight over the burnt cheese at the bottom.
Those who succeed in following the etiquette of fondue can share the cheese cracker-like ''la religieuse'' left at the bottom of the emptied caquelon.
