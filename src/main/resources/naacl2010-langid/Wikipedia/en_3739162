'''The New Teacher Project''' (TNTP) is a U.S.-wide non-profit organization dedicated to increasing the number of outstanding individuals who become public school teachers and to creating environments for all educators that maximize their impact on student achievement. Since 1997, TNTP has partnered with school districts, state education agencies, colleges and universities, and other educational entities to accomplish these goals. To date, TNTP has recruited, prepared or certified nearly 20,000 high-quality teachers, worked with more than 150 school districts and established more than 40 programs in 22 states.
''' (Fellows) Programs'''
One type of program The New Teacher Project runs for school districts supplements the traditionally prepared teacher pool by providing a shorter pathway to the classroom for qualified, motivated individuals without a formal background in education.  Usually these programs take people from other careers or straight from college.  After a competitive selection process, they go through a quick, intense training program and then continue their professional training while actually teaching in the classroom.  This is often more financially feasible than going back to school, paying tuition and then spending time as a student teacher.  The learning curve is steep, but these programs have been returning impressive results and helping cities meet their teacher shortages.
