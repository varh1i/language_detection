'''Apollo 13''' was the third manned lunar-landing mission, part of  under  in the United States. The crew members were Commander , Command Module pilot , and Lunar Module pilot . It launched on ,  at 13:13 CST. Two days after the launch, the Apollo spacecraft was crippled by an explosion, caused by a fault in an oxygen tank. The explosion damaged the , resulting in a loss of oxygen and electrical power. The crew used the  as a “lifeboat” in space. The  remained fully functional on its internal batteries, but they were needed for re-entry and landing so it was shut down shortly after the accident. Despite great hardship caused by severe constraints on power, cabin heat, and potable water, the crew successfully returned to Earth. The mission was thus called a "Successful Failure".<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/index.html Apollo 13 - A Successful Failure]</ref>

 was originally slated to be the Command Module pilot. After being exposed to {{ndash}} a disease to which Mattingly was not immune{{ndash}} contracted by backup Lunar Module pilot , Mattingly was grounded shortly before launch. He was replaced by Jack Swigert, and later flew with the Apollo 13 backup crew as CMP of . Mattingly never contracted rubella.
The Apollo 13 mission was scheduled to explore the , or Fra Mauro highlands, named after the 80-kilometer-diameter , located within it. It is a widespread, hilly geological (or more properly, ) area covering large portions of the lunar surface around , and is thought to be composed of ejecta from the impact which formed the mare. With the failure of the mission, the flight to Fra Mauro was done on .
The flight's problems began during the liftoff with a lesser-known malfunction: during the second-stage burn, the center engine shut down two minutes early. The four outer engines were run for longer than planned, to compensate for this.<ref>[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4204/ch22-7.html Apollo 14 Launch Operations (comments on Apollo 13 pogo)], Moonport: A History of Apollo Launch Facilities and Operations, NASA</ref> Engineers later discovered that this was due to dangerous s which might have torn the second stage apart; the engine was experiencing 68g vibrations at 16 hertz, flexing the thrust frame by {{convert|3|in|mm}}. However, the oscillations caused a sensor to register excessively low average pressure, and the computer shut the engine down automatically.<ref>[http://www.engineeringatboeing.com/articles/pogo.htm Pogo], Jim Fenwick, ''Threshold'' - Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne’s engineering journal of power technology, Spring 1992</ref> Smaller pogo oscillations had been seen on previous Apollo missions (and had been recognized as a potential problem from the earliest unmanned Titan-Gemini flights), but on Apollo 13 they had been amplified by an unexpected interaction with the cavitation in the turbo-pumps.<ref>[http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/winter2004/05.html Mitigating Pogo on Liquid-Fueled Rockets], Aerospace Corporation Crosslink magazine, Winter 2004 edition</ref> Later missions included anti-pogo modifications, which had been under development since before Apollo 13. Those modifications solved the problem. They entailed (a) the addition of a helium gas reservoir in the center engine’s  line to dampen pressure oscillations, (b) an automatic cutoff for the center engine in case this failed, and (c) simplified propellant valves on all five second-stage engines.
As the spacecraft was on its way to the Moon, at a distance of 321,860 kilometers (199,990 mi) from Earth, the number two , one of two tanks contained in the  (SM), exploded.  (It is important to note that the [http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700076776_1970076776.pdf report of the Apollo 13 review board] does not refer to this incident as an "explosion", instead detailing how the oxygen tanks were designed with rupture disks and other safeties to ''prevent'' a catastrophic explosion.)
This explosion caused damage to other parts of the Service Module, including, critically, the number one oxygen tank. Because the  (CSM) relied on the oxygen tanks to generate electricity, damage to number one tank meant that very little power was available for the spacecraft. The  (CM) contained batteries for use during re-entry after the SM was jettisoned, but these would only last about ten hours. Because the power needed to be saved for re-entry, the crew survived by using the LM, still attached to the CSM, as a "lifeboat". The LM "lifeboat" procedure had actually been created during a training simulation (in the simulator) not long before the flight of Apollo 13.<ref>Lovell, Jim, and Jeffrey Kluger. Apollo 13. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2000. 83-87</ref>
 
The damage done to the CSM meant that the planned Moon-landing at the  Highlands had to be scrubbed. To return the crew to Earth as quickly and safely as possible, only a single pass around the  was made, in what is called a '''', which uses the Moon's gravity to "slingshot" the spacecraft back to . To enter this trajectory, a significant course correction was required. This would normally have been a simple procedure, using the SM  engine, but the s did not know exactly how much damage the service module had taken, and did not want to risk firing the main engine. Therefore the course correction was performed by firing the LM's descent engine, an option settled upon after extensive discussion among the engineers on the ground. The initial maneuver to change to a free return trajectory was made within hours of the accident. After passage around the Moon, the descent engine was fired again for a ''PC+2'' burn ( + '''2''' hours) in order to accelerate the spacecraft's return to Earth. Afterwards, only one more descent engine burn was required, for a minor course correction.
Considerable ingenuity under extreme pressure was required from both the crew and the s to work out how to  the craft for the crew's safe return, with much of the world watching the developing drama on television. (Because of the severe electrical power limitations following the explosion, no live TV broadcasts were made from the craft for the remainder of the mission; network commentators used models and animated footage to illustrate their coverage).

A major challenge in keeping the crew alive was that the LM "lifeboat" was only equipped to sustain two people for two days, but had to sustain three people for four days, an increase by a factor of three. The  canisters available for the LM's s would not last for all four days. The CM had an adequate supply of replacement canisters, but they were the wrong shape to fit the LM's receptacle. An adapter then had to be fabricated from materials in the spacecraft. The astronauts called it the "mailbox."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2002-000056.html|title=Interior View of the Apollo 13 Lunar Module and the "Mailbox"|date=2007-01-16}}</ref>
 during the Apollo 13 mission.]]
Due to reduced temperatures on the return leg of the mission, there was extensive water condensation in the CM. There was some fear that this condensation could seriously damage the electronics of the Command Module by causing a short circuit. Until the electronics were activated, it was impossible to know whether this would occur. The equipment worked normally when activated, however, partly due to the extensive design modifications made to the CM after the fire aboard .
As the time for re-entry into Earth's atmosphere approached, NASA took the unusual step of jettisoning the Service Module before the Lunar Module, so pictures of the SM could be taken for later analysis. When the crew saw the damaged service module, they reported that the access panel covering the oxygen tanks and fuel cells, which extended the entire length of the Module's body, had been blown off.
The crew returned unharmed to Earth, although Haise had a  as a result of the scarcity of potable water on the damaged ship and the difficulty of urine disposal. (The crew was instructed to store urine and other waste products on board instead of dumping them into space, to avoid altering the trajectory of the spacecraft.)<ref>[http://history.nasa.gov/SP-350/ch-13-5.html Account of Apollo 13 by James Lovell], NASA website</ref>
Although the explosion forced the mission to be aborted, the crew was fortunate that it occurred on the first leg of the mission, when they had maximum of supplies, equipment, and power. If the explosion had occurred while in orbit around the Moon or on the return leg after the LM had been jettisoned, the crew would have had a significantly smaller probability of survival.
Ironically, the crew's lives may have been saved by another failure in the oxygen tanks. At around 46 hours and 40 minutes into the mission, the oxygen tank 2 quantity gauge went "off-scale high" (reading over 100%) and stayed there. As a result of this failure, and to assist in determining the cause, the crew was asked to perform cryo-tank stirs more often than originally planned. In the original mission plan, the stir which blew out the tank would have occurred after the lunar landing.<ref>[http://www.dunamai.com/articles/American_History/stir_saved_apollo_13.htm "THE STIR THAT SAVED THE LIVES OF APOLLO 13's CREW", Jerry Woodfill, retrieved 27 January 2007]</ref>
 following splashdown]]
The explosion on Apollo 13 led to a lengthy investigation of the underlying cause. Based on detailed manufacturing records and logs of mission problems, the oxygen tank failure was tracked to a combination of multiple faults. Individually, they were not critical problems; but together they led to near disaster for Apollo 13.
s, such as liquid oxygen or liquid hydrogen, require great care in handling, and most storage containers holding them are unsealed so that pressure from expanding gas will not cause the container to fail. The Apollo’s liquid oxygen tanks were made capable of safely holding liquid oxygen at  pressures for years before it evaporated, because of their design and insulation. Each tank was able to hold several hundred pounds of the highly pressurized liquid to supply the craft with oxygen, fuel for , and water from the byproducts of the . However, the very characteristics that made the tank useful made internal inspection impossible.
The tank was made of several basic components that were relevant to the accident:
These were the basic design, manufacturing, and operational problems that led to the accident:
Following the established protocol for crew rotation on Apollo missions the original prime crew for Apollo 13 was the back up crew for  that would have seen Mercury veteran  command the mission with Lovell's crew being  (as they were the backup crew for the historic  mission).  , the Director of Flight Crew Operations ("Chief Astronaut") bumped Cooper from the position in favor of  veteran , who recovered from an experimental, yet successful operation to correct an inner ear disorder.  In addition to Shepard's reinstatement, Cooper was also bumped due to his criticism toward the NASA management, criticisms that go back to the days of his preparation for the  mission that almost led to him being grounded and replaced by Shepard due to an unauthorized low-level flyby ("flathatting") of the Mercury Operations office at Cape Canaveral. In a change from the usual procedure, the prime crews of 13 and 14 were swapped, to afford Shepard more time to prepare.
Two days before the launch, backup Lunar Module pilot  contracted  (German measles) from one of his children, exposing the main crew. Although Lovell and Haise had had rubella as children, command module pilot  had not, and the flight surgeons grounded him, replacing him with Swigert.  This may have been a blessing in disguise for him &ndash; Mattingly never developed rubella, and later flew on , , and , retiring from both NASA and the U.S. Navy with the rank of .  Mattingly was also able, using the simulator, to map out a plan for the astronauts to get the module going again using the limited power supply they had left.
There was no time to properly replace the original  on ''Aquarius'' (which bore Mattingly’s name), so Jim Lovell was given a replacement (with Swigert’s name) to put over the original plaque once they landed on the moon. However, because the lunar landing was never made, Lovell kept the plaque, which is one of the few mementos from the mission that he has on display at his home.
As a result of following the , the altitude of Apollo 13 over the  was approximately 100 km greater than the corresponding orbital altitude on the remaining Apollo lunar missions. This could mean an all-time  record for human spaceflight, not even superseded as of 2008; however, the variation in distance between Earth and the Moon, owing to the  of the Moon's orbit about Earth, is much larger than 100 km, so it is not certain whether the actual distance from Earth was greater than that of all other Apollo missions. '''' listed this flight as having the absolute altitude record for a manned spacecraft, and Lovell should have received a certificate from them attesting to this record. (Lovell wrote in the book ''Lost Moon'' &mdash; later renamed ''Apollo 13'', that apart from the plaque and a couple of other pieces of salvage, the only other item he possessed regarding the Apollo 13 mission was a letter from .)
The splashdown point was {{coor dm|21|38|S|165|22|W|}}, SE of American Samoa and 6.5 km (4 mi) from the recovery ship, .
Superstitious people have associated the  with the mission, due to the fact that the mission began on ,  (4/11/70, digits summing to 13) at 13:13  from Complex 39 (three times thirteen), the problems began on , and the mission is called Apollo 13.  Other coincidental appearances of the number 13 connected to the mission included the explosion occurring at 19:13 CST, and a post-flight estimate that, had the explosion occurred on the ground, repairing the damage would have cost $13 million. In a feature on the making of the ''Apollo 13'' film, Jim Lovell pointed out that NASA has never had another spacecraft numbered 13. However, in NASA's  for the return to the moon, an upcoming spaceflight is to be called .
The  spacesuit worn by Lovell would have been the first to feature red bands on the arms and legs of the suit, as well as on the life-support backpack and lunar EVA helmet assembly, to easily distinguish him from Haise. This was done because during the  mission, Mission Control personnel watching the video feed had trouble distinguishing the two astronauts while both  and  had their side sunshades extended down. The red bands were a feature for the remaining Apollo flights, and are used on the s worn by the astronauts of the  and on the  (ISS).
The Apollo 13 mission has been called “A Successful Failure”, in that the astronauts were successfully brought home despite not landing on the moon.
The  was awarded the  for their actions during the mission, as were the astronauts.
The Cold Cathode Gauge Experiment (CCGE), which was flown as part of the  (ALSEP) on Apollo 13, was never flown again. It was a version of the Cold Cathode Ion Gauge (CCIG) which was flown on , , and . The CCGE was designed as a stand-alone version of the CCIG. On other missions, the CCIG was connected as part of the Suprathermal Ion Detector (SIDE). Because of the aborted landing, this experiment was never actually deployed. Other experiments included on Apollo 13's ALSEP included the Heat Flow Experiment (HFE), the Passive Seismic Experiment (PSE), and the Charged Particle Lunar Environment Experiment (CPLEE).<ref>[http://www.myspacemuseum.com/alsepu1.htm Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package (ALSEP)]</ref>
 Aerospace Corporation, the builder of the LM, issued an invoice <ref>[http://www.geocities.com/capecanaveral/4411/apollo13.htm Invoice from  for towing the North American built CM]</ref> for $312,421.24 to , the builder of the CM module, for "towing" the crippled ship most of the way to the Moon and back.  The invoice was drawn up as a gag following Apollo 13's successful splashdown by one of the pilots for Grumman, Sam Greenberg.  He had earlier helped with the strategy for rerouting power from the LM to the crippled CM.  The invoice included a 20% commercial discount, as well as a further 2% discount if North American were to pay in cash.  North American politely declined payment, citing that they had ferried Grumman LMs to the Moon on two previous occasions with no such reciprocal charges.
The Apollo 13 logo featured three flying horses of Apollo's chariot across space, the motto “''Ex luna, scientia''” (from the Moon, knowledge, borrowed from the 's motto, in which Lovell was a graduate, "''Ex tridens, scientia''," from the sea, knowledge), and the number of the mission in  (APOLLO ). It is one of two Apollo insignias (the other being that of ) not to include the names of the crew (which was fortunate, considering that , one of the original crew members, was replaced not long before the mission began). It was designed by artist [http://genedorr.com/patches/Artists.html#winter Lumen Winter], who based it on a mural he had done for the St. Regis Hotel in New York; the mural was later purchased by actor , who portrayed Lovell in the movie '''', and now is on the wall of a restaurant in Chicago, owned by Lovell's son.
The command module shell was formerly at the , in . The interior components were removed during the investigation of the accident and reassembled into BP-1102A, the water egress training module, and were subsequently on display at the  in , until 2000. Jim Lovell's lunar helmet is located at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. The command module and the internal components were reassembled, and ''Odyssey'' is currently on display at the , .
The lunar module burned up in Earth's atmosphere on , , having been targeted to enter over the Pacific Ocean to reduce the possibility of contamination from a   (RTG) on board. (Had the mission proceeded as planned, the RTG would have been used to power the , and then remained on the Moon.) The RTG survived re-entry (as designed) and landed in the . While it will remain radioactive for approximately 2,000 years, it does not appear to be releasing any of its 3.9 kg of radioactive plutonium.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/neep602/SPRING00/lecture39.pdf | title = General Safety Considerations | format = pdf lecture notes | publisher = Fusion Technology Institute,  | date = Spring 2000 }}</ref> NASA has expressed a wish that the RTG be recovered. {{Fact|date=December 2007}}
Portions of the events surrounding the Apollo 13 mission (from the perspective of the television reporters covering the mission) are dramatized in the miniseries '''' episode entitled .
'''', a film based on '''',  and  book about the event (since retitled ''Apollo 13''), was released in 1995. It was directed by  and starred  as Jim Lovell,  as Fred Haise,  as Jack Swigart,  as  ,  as Marilyn Lovell and  as Ken Mattingly. Jim Lovell, Gene Kranz, and other principals have stated that this film depicted the events of the mission with reasonable accuracy, though some  was taken and some technical inaccuracies have been noted. The film is among several to misquote Lovell's famous statement, "Houston, we've had a problem."<ref>{{cite web
   
The 1974 movie '''', while set around the Apollo 13 incident, is a fictional drama about the crises faced by ground personnel, when the emergency disrupts their work schedules and places additional stress on their lives; only a couple of news clips and a narrator's solemn voice deal with the actual problems.
