'''John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh'''  (  &ndash;  ) was an   who with  discovered the element , an achievement for which he earned the  in 1904. He also discovered the phenomenon now called  and predicted the existence of the s now known as .
Strutt was born in Langford Grove,  and in his early years suffered frailty and poor health. He attended  and began studying mathematics at , , in 1861.  In 1865, he obtained his BA ( and 1st ) and MA in 1868. He was subsequently elected to a Fellowship of Trinity. He held the post until his marriage to Evelyn Balfour, daughter of  in 1871. He had three sons with her.<ref name=prixnobel>{{cite web | author= | title=Lord Rayleigh - Biography | url=http://www.nobel.se/physics/laureates/1904/strutt-bio.html | work=Les Prix Nobel | publisher=The Nobel Foundation | date=1904  | accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref>
In 1873 his father, John Strutt, 2nd Baron Rayleigh died, and he inherited the .
He was the second  at the , following  in this position from 1879 to 1884. He first described  by  in 1883 in the British journal ''''.
Approximately 1900 Lord Rayleigh developed the  (Human sound localization using two ). Interaural time delay (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD) (assuming a spherical head with no external ). Humans perceive sound objects spatially, using the difference in the phase (time delay) of the sound and the difference in amplitude (level) between the two ears, in a similar way that stereoscopic sight provides depth perception. Also called two primary cues for azimuth (horizontal location) but possibly its two primary cues for a 3 dimensional bearing. For example when you hear a seagull call out you can determine roughly x y and z location of the sound. Although Pinnae reflections are considered a main cue for vertical localisation.
Lord Rayleigh was elected Fellow of the  on ,  and served as president of the Royal Society from 1905 to 1908. He died on ,  in .
s on  and the  are named in his honor as well as a type of surface wave known as a . The   was named in his honour on 1 June 2007.<ref>{{cite web | author=JPL | title=JPL Small-Body Database Browser: 22740 Rayleigh | url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=22740 | publisher=NASA  | date=2008 | accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref>
