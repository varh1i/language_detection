The '''Nude Bowl''' was a popular skateboarding locale from the late 1970s to the early 1990s.<ref name='chrismccaw'>[http://www.chrismccaw.com/nude_bowl/index.html The Nude Bowl<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The name comes from the fact that the site was once a  resort named "Desert Gardens Ranch."<ref>[http://www.dhshistoricalsociety.com Desert Hot Springs Historical Society<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
It was located outside  and consisted of an abandoned kidney bean shaped swimming pool and a few foundations of buildings that used to surround the area.  There was no road to the Nude Bowl, so visitors had to travel through the desert. Initially, the Nude Bowl was merely a skateboarding party location, but by the 1990s, large parties and violence became commonplace there.<ref>http://www.sdreader.com/published/2006-05-25/blurt.html</ref> After numerous complaints about guns and fighting around the Nude Bowl, the police filled it in with dirt. Skateboarders returned, removed the dirt, and repaired the bowl.<ref>[http://www.ocweekly.com/features/features/skate-and-destroy/18808/ Orange County Weekly - Skate and Destroy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
After a few months, the police broke up the concrete and buried the remains of the bowl.
The history of the Nude Bowl is the subject of  popular song "Nude Bowl Resurrection". The Palm Springs Skatepark contains a replica of the Nude Bowl, which is the most popular feature in the park.<ref>[http://www.ci.palm-springs.ca.us/parks/skate_park.html City of Palm Springs - Skate Park<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
