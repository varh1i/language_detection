The following year, they struck in the opposite direction, marching through Thessaloniki to tear off Thessaly and the southernmost parts of the Bulgarian Empire. Although the Bulgarian commander of the fortress of Veroia, Dobromir, was married to one of Samuel's nieces, he voluntarily surrendered the fort and joined the Byzantines.<ref>Ibidem.

Meanwhile, Basil II's campaign seized many towns in Thessaly. He forced the Bulgarian population of the conquered areas to resettle in the Voleron area between the  and  rivers.  resisted for weeks but after a long siege was conquered. The population was moved to Voleron and its governor Dragshan was taken to Thessaloniki, where he was betrothed to the daughter of a local noble.  Unwilling to be married to an enemy, Dragshan three times tried to flee to Bulgaria and was eventually executed.<ref>Skylitzes, pp. 452–454.</ref>
The Byzantine-Bulgarian conflict reached its height in 1003 when Hungary became involved. Since the beginning of the 9th century, the Bulgarian territory had stretched beyond the  as far as the  River and the middle Danube. During the reign of Samuel, the governor of these northwestern parts was Duke , the grandson of Duke , who was defeated by the Hungarians in 930s. Ahtum commanded a strong army and firmly defended the northwestern borders of the Empire. He also built many churches and monasteries through which he spread  in .<ref>''Legenda Saneti Gerhardi episcopi'', p. 489.</ref><ref>Venedikov, p. 150.</ref>    
Although Gavril Radomir's marriage to the daughter of the Hungarian ruler had established friendly relation between the two strongest states in the Danube area, the relationship deteriorated after Géza's death.  The Bulgarians supported Gyula and Koppány as rulers instead of Géza's .  As a result of the conflict, the marriage between Gavril Radomir and the Hungarian princess was dissolved.  The Hungarians then attacked Ahtum, who had directly backed the pretenders for the Hungarian crown.  Stephen I convinced Hanadin, Ahtum's right-hand man, to help in the attack. When the conspiracy was uncovered Hanadin fled and joined the Hungarian forces.<ref>''Legenda Saneti Gerhardi episcopi'', p. 492–493.</ref>    At the same time, a strong Byzantine army besieged Vidin, Ahtum's seat. Although many soldiers were required to participate in the defense of the town, Ahtum was occupied with the war to the north. After several months he died in battle when his troops were defeated by the Hungarians.<ref>Venedikov, pp. 151–152.</ref>  As a result of the war, Bulgarian influence to the northwest of the Danube diminished.
The Byzantines took advantage of Bulgarian difficulties in the north. In 1003, Basil II led a large army to Vidin, northwestern Bulgaria's most important town. After an eight-month siege, the invaders captured the fortress by force.<ref>Skylitzes, p. 454.</ref>    The commanders of the town repulsed all attempts to break its defence, including the use of .<ref name=prokic30>Prokić, p. 30.</ref>    While Basil's forces were engaged there, Samuel struck in the opposite direction: on  he attacked  and plundered the area.<ref>Skylitzes, pp. 454–455.</ref> The Byzantines continued the siege of Vidin and finally gained the town after a betrayal by the local bishop.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ivanov |first=Jordan |title=Bulgarian historical monuments in Macedonia (Balgarski starini iz Makedoniya, Български старини из Македония) |year=1970 |origyear=1931 |publisher=Nauka i izkustvo |location=Sofia |pages=p. 557 |language=Bulgarian |oclc=3736478 }}</ref>  
Basil II then decided to return to Constantinople, but, fearing an encounter with the Bulgarian army on the main road to his capital, he used an alternate route. The Byzantines marched south through the  valley and reached a key Bulgarian city, , in 1004. The Bulgarian army was camping on the opposite side of the .

In the same year, Samuel undertook a march against Thessaloniki. He ambushed and captured its governor, Ioannes Chaldus,<ref name=prokic30/><ref>Actes d'Iviron I.

The setbacks in the war demoralized some of Samuil's military commanders, especially the captured Byzantine nobles. Samuel's son-in-law Ashot, the governor of Dyrrhachium, made contact with the local Byzantines and the influential Ioannes Chryselios, Samuel's father-in-law. Ashot and his wife boarded one of the enemy ships that beleaguered the town, and fled to Constantinople.

From 1006 to 1013, neither side had much success and the balance of power remained unchanged.

Since the Byzantines usually used the valley of the  for their invasions into Bulgaria, Samuel built a thick wooden wall in the gorges around the village of  (''Kleidion'', "key") to bar the enemy's way.  When Basil II launched his next campaign in the summer of 1014, his army suffered heavy casualties in assaults against the wall.

The battle of Kleidion had major political consequences.
