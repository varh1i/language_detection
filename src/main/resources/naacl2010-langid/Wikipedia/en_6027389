The '''2004 North Indian Ocean cyclone season''' had no bounds, but cyclones tend to form between April and December, with peaks in May and November. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern . 
__TOC__
In 2004, RSMC New Delhi identified one Very Severe Cyclonic Storm and three Severe Cyclonic Storms. Out of the four cyclonic storms, three developed over the Arabian Sea and only one formed over the Bay of Bengal. Joint Typhoon Warning Center identified one more tropical cyclones(4A) in Arabian sea. The notable features is that the Arabian sea was more active than the Bay of Bengal during 2004.
The Arabian sea severe cyclone “Agni” in November formed very close to the equator near latitude 1.5N. Cyclogenesis over the north Indian Ocean at such low latitudes has not occurred in the past. The coexistence of cyclonic disturbances over the Arabian sea and the Bay of Bengal as occurred in June 2004 is also not common. This had however helped the progress of the southwest monsoon across the country during the onset phase.
This was the first North Indian season that featured the naming of storms, though only two storms received names.
On , Tropical Depression 1A developed in the Arabian Sea, 200&nbsp;miles west of the Indian coast. It wandered for the next three days, slowly strengthening to its peak of 50&nbsp;mph winds. The tropical storm turned northwestward, where dry air and moderate shear caused the system to dissipate on the 10th.

A tropical storm formed on  in the Bay of Bengal, 230 nautical miles south of . It drifted southwestward initially, followed by a turn to the northeast where it intensified to a 70&nbsp;mph tropical storm. Not long after on the 19th, the tropical storm hit , and dissipated later that day. The storm caused heavy flooding and damage, amounting to 220 casualties.

On , a tropical depression developed in the northeastern Arabian Sea. It moved northeastward, where it strengthened into a tropical storm on the 2nd. The name, "Onil" was the first cyclonic system to ever be named in history of the North Indian Ocean cyclones. Onil later reached a peak with sustained winds of 45&nbsp;mph, though other forecasting agencies estimated a stronger storm. Regardless, the storm entrained dry air and rapidly weakened. Though operationally Onil was said to have made landfall on India, the low level circulation halted just before landfall, drifted southward, and dissipated on the 10th.
In the post-analysis by RSMC New Delhi, the system weakened into a depression over Gujarat-Kutch coast in the evening of 3 October without crossing the coast.

A depression existed in the Bay of Bengal between  and  before making landfall on the fourth.

A depression developed over land near the India-Bangladesh border on , traveled northeast over Bangladesh, and dissipated on .

A tropical storm developed in the central Arabian Sea on . It moved generally westward, where it slowly weakened until dissipating on the 7th.

On , an area of convection developed and persisted about 500&nbsp;miles east-southeast of . Under an area of moderate vertical shear, it moved west-southwestward and slowly organized. It nearly dissipated on the 24th, but redeveloped on the 26th under an area of favorable upper level winds and good diffluence aloft. On , it became Tropical Depression 5A, and after moving to the west-southwest, became Tropical Storm Agni on the 28th only 50&nbsp;miles from the  (about 0.7°N). In its developmental stages, its circulation crossed the equator briefly into the southern hemisphere, while retaining its counter-clockwise spin. Under unusually favorable conditions so close to the equator, Agni strengthened and turned to the northwest. The convection concentrated, and quickly became a cyclone on . A pinhole eye briefly developed, but dry air and vertical wind shear weakened Agni back to a tropical storm. The effects were temporary, and Agni re-attained cyclone status on the 30th. On , the shear and dry air returned, and Agni again weakened back to a tropical storm. After moving to the northwest for much of its lifetime, the storm turned to the west towards northeastern , under the influence of the  to its north. Late on , the storm weakened to a tropical depression, and made landfall on eastern  on the 4th. It turned to the south, and dissipated after reaching the  on .
When Tropical Storm Agni reached a position of 50&nbsp;miles north of the equator, it became the nearest a tropical cyclone has ever approached to the equator, less than half of 's previous record distance of 103&nbsp;miles. However, because Agni formed more to the north and tracked southwestward, Vamei retains the record for the southernmost formation. RSMC New Delhi also admitted that cyclogenesis over the north Indian Ocean at such low latitudes has not occurred in the past. Because the storm was weak and the convection disorganized when it hit Somalia, no damage or deaths were reported from the storm.<ref>[http://australiasevereweather.com/cyclones/2005/summ0411.htm Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary November 2004<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Tropical cyclone naming in the North Indian Ocean began in 2004. The following names were used.
