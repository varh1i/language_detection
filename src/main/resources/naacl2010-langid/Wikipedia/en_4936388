This is the new logo and official seal of the Lyceum of the Philippines University (LPU) created by McCann-Erickson in 2005. It was distributed by the LPU - Management Information Systems (MIS) in coordination with the LPU Administration. 
This image was obtained and edited from the Sotero H. Laurel Electronic Library. The logo is in a shield form, with "Lyceum" on top and in scroll, at the bottom "A Jose P. Laurel Legacy" keeping the laurel leaves at its side. The Lyceum logo serves as the "new face" and "new direction" of the university.
Promotion of the university is the main purpose of this image adoption.
