'''Kepatihan''' is a type of cipher  that was devised for notation of the n . 
The system was devised around 1900 at the Kepatihan in Surakarta, and is often said to be based upon the  system of 1894, the pitches 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of  often falling near .   It is however possible that it originated instead in the  system whose pitches which are numbered 1-7, and where 4 and 7 are generally altered notes (a 4 can be used as a 'sharp' 3 (common in ) or 'flat' 5 (usual in ), and 7 appears often as an upper neighbor tone in ; a 'raised' 1 in  can usually be interpreted as a modulation).
The pitches of the seven-tone  tuning system are designated by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7; while the five-tone  pitches are notated as 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. The octaves are noted by dots above and below the numbers, as in  , although of course the pitches do not correspond. The rhythms are noted by beams or lines above notes indicating half the rhythmic value, and dots in where the notes go (''pin'') indicating either rests or extentions. s and slured bowing are noted by lines underneath the numbers.  instruments are indicated by diacritical marks (a circle for , parentheses for , ^ for , Ë‡ for , + for , and - for ), or are omitted as they can be determined from the , or form.
Ordinarily the system only notates the  (the core melody as it is played by the s) and  (choral parts). However, for pedagogical purposes, other patterns, such as the melodic formulas  and  used on the  instruments may be notated.
Kepatihan is widely used in  studies of the gamelan, sometimes accompanied by transcriptions in to Western  with approximated pitches.
