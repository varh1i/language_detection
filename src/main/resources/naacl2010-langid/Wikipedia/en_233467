'''''Trial by Jury''''' is a  in one act, with music by  and  by .  It was first produced on  , at 's , where it initially ran for 131&nbsp;performances and was considered a hit, receiving critical praise and outrunning its popular companion piece, 's ''''.  The story concerns a " of marriage" lawsuit in which the judge and legal system are the objects of lighthearted .
Gilbert based the libretto of ''Trial by Jury'' on an operetta parody that he had written in 1868.  The opera premiered more than three years after 's only previous collaboration, '''', an 1871–72 Christmas season entertainment.  In the intervening years, both the author and composer were busy with separate projects.  Beginning in 1873, Gilbert tried several times to get the opera produced before the   suggested that he collaborate on it with Sullivan.  Sullivan was pleased with the piece and promptly wrote the music. 
As with most Gilbert and Sullivan operas, the plot of ''Trial by Jury'' is ludicrous, but the characters behave as if the events were perfectly reasonable.  This narrative technique blunts some of the pointed barbs aimed at hypocrisy, especially of those in authority, and the sometimes base motives of supposedly respectable people and institutions.  These themes became favourites of Gilbert through the rest of his collaborations with Sullivan.  Critics and audiences praised how well Sullivan's witty and good-humoured music complemented Gilbert's satire.<ref>Stedman, pp. 129&ndash;30</ref>  The success of ''Trial by Jury'' launched the famous series of 13&nbsp;collaborative works between Gilbert and Sullivan that came to be known as the .
After its original production in 1875, ''Trial by Jury'' toured widely in Britain and elsewhere and was frequently revived and recorded.  It also became popular as a part of charity benefits.  The work continues to be frequently played, especially as a companion piece to other short Gilbert and Sullivan operas or other works.  According to theatre scholar Kurt Gänzl, it is "probably the most successful British one-act operetta of all time".<ref name=Ganzl90 />
Before ''Trial by Jury'',  and  had collaborated on one previous opera, '''', in 1871.  Although reasonably successful, it was a Christmas entertainment, and such works were not expected to endure.<ref name=Rees78>Rees, p. 78</ref>  Between ''Thespis'' and ''Trial by Jury'',  did not collaborate on any further operas.  Gilbert wrote several short stories, edited the second volume of his comic '''', and created 11&nbsp;theatrical works, including '''' (1873), '''' (1874) and '''' (1874).<ref>Stedman, pp. 99&ndash;127</ref>  At the same time, Sullivan wrote various pieces of religious music, including the '''' (1872) and an oratorio, '''' (1873), and edited ''Church Hymns, with Tunes'' (1874), which included 45 of his own hymns and arrangements.<ref name=Ainger106/>  He also wrote many  and other songs, including three in 1874&ndash;75 with words by Gilbert: "The Distant Shore", "Sweethearts" (inspired by ) and "The Love that Loves Me Not".<ref name=Ainger106>Ainger, p. 106</ref>
'' in 1868]]
The story of ''Trial by Jury'' started in 1868, when Gilbert wrote a single-page illustrated comic piece for the magazine '''' entitled ''Trial by Jury: An Operetta''.  Drawing on Gilbert's training and brief practice as a , it detailed a "" trial going awry, in the process spoofing the law, lawyers and the legal system.  (In the , a man could be required to pay compensation should he fail to marry a woman to whom he was engaged.)  The outline of this story was followed in the later opera, and two of its numbers appeared in nearly their final form in ''Fun''.  The skit, however, ended abruptly: the moment the attractive plaintiff stepped into the witness box, the judge leapt into her arms and vowed to marry her, whereas in the opera, the case is allowed to proceed further before this conclusion is reached.<ref>[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/bab_ballads/html/trial.html ''Trial by Jury: An Operetta''], from '''',  ; Also [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/trial/libretto.txt ''Trial by Jury''.] (Gilbert and Sullivan Archive editions, accessed  )</ref><ref>Bradley, pp. 6, 24, 36</ref>
In 1873, Gilbert arranged with the opera manager and composer, , to expand the piece into a one-act .  Rosa was to write the music, and , his wife and an old friend of Gilbert's, was to sing the role of the Plaintiff, as part of a season of English opera that Rosa planned to present at the .<ref>Ainger, pp. 101–02 and 105</ref>  Rosa's wife died in childbirth in 1874, and the despondent Rosa dropped the project.<ref>Stedman, pp. 120&ndash;21</ref>  Later in the same year, Gilbert offered the libretto to the impresario , but Carte knew of no composer available to set it to music.<ref>Stedman, p. 125</ref>  
Meanwhile, Sullivan may have been considering a return to : '''', his first comic opera, had received a London revival (co-starring his brother, ) in September 1874.  In November, Sullivan travelled to Paris and contacted Albert Millaud, one of the librettists for 's operettas.  However, he returned to London empty-handed and worked on  for the 's production of ''''.<ref>Ainger, pp. 107&ndash;08</ref>  By early 1875, Carte was managing 's , and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach's '''' (in which Dolaro starred).  Carte asked Sullivan to compose something for the theatre and advertised in '''' in late January: "In Preparation, a New Comic Opera composed expressly for this theatre by Mr. Arthur Sullivan in which Madame Dolaro and  will appear."<ref name=Ainger108>Ainger, p. 108</ref><ref>Apparently, this refers to another opera that Sullivan was working on for the Royalty, since an advertisement in ''The Era'' on   stated that "In consequence of the continued success of ''La Périchole'', the production of Mr. Sullivan's two-act opera is postponed" (McElroy, p.&nbsp;40).  A gossip column in the ''Athenæum'', dated  , stated that Sullivan was working on new music for a piece at the .  From this, McElroy speculates that Sullivan had already begun writing musical numbers for '''' before he shifted his energies to ''Trial by Jury'' and decided "to salvage them by telling [his librettist] to boil the libretto down to one act and [transfer] the project to another theatre." (McElroy, pp. 51&ndash;52)</ref>  But around the same time, Carte also remembered Gilbert's ''Trial by Jury'' and knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create ''Thespis''.  He suggested to Gilbert that Sullivan was the man to write the music for ''Trial''.<ref name=Ainger108/>  
Gilbert read the libretto to Sullivan on  .  Sullivan was enthusiastic, later recalling, "[Gilbert] read it through...&nbsp;in the manner of a man considerably disappointed with what he had written.  As soon as he had come to the last word, he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious of the fact that he had achieved his purpose so far as I was concerned, inasmuch as I was screaming with laughter the whole time."<ref name=Ainger109>Ainger, p. 109</ref>  ''Trial by Jury'', described as "A Novel and Original Dramatic Cantata" in the original promotional material,<ref>See [http://www.library.rochester.edu/index.cfm?page=4089&Print=21 this First edition libretto cover] on exhibition at the University of Rochester Libraries.

Initially, ''Trial by Jury'', which runs only 30&nbsp;minutes or so, was played last on a triple bill, on which the main attraction, '''' (starring Dolaro as the title character and Fred Sullivan as Don Andres), was preceded by the one-act  ''''.<ref name=Ainger109/>  The latter was immediately replaced by a series of other curtain raisers.<ref name=Ainger110>Ainger, p. 110</ref>  Arthur Sullivan conducted the first night's performance, and the theatre's music director, B.

One of the choristers in ''Trial by Jury'', , was promoted in November 1875<ref name=Ainger114>Ainger, p. 114</ref> to the small part of the Foreman of the Jury and made a strong impact on audiences with his amusing facial expressions and gestures.<ref name=Walbrook3840>Walbrook, pp. 38&ndash;40</ref>  In March 1876, he temporarily replaced Fred Sullivan as the Judge, when Fred's health declined from tuberculosis.<ref>Ainger, pp. 113, 120</ref>  With this start, Penley went on to a successful career as comic actor, culminating with the lead role in the record-breaking original production of ''''.<ref name=Walbrook3840/> Fred Sullivan died in January 1877.<ref>Ainger, p. 128</ref>

''Trial by Jury'' soon became the most desirable supporting piece for any London production, and, outside London, the major British theatrical touring companies had added it to their repertoire by about 1877.<ref name=Ganzl8990 />  The original production was even given a world tour by  assistant manager Emily Soldene, which travelled as far as Australia.<ref name=Ganzl8990>Gänzl, pp. 89&ndash;90</ref>  Unauthorised "pirate" productions quickly sprang up in America, taking advantage of the fact that American courts did not enforce foreign copyrights.<ref name=Ganzl95>Gänzl, p. 95</ref><ref name=Ainger114/>  It also became popular as part of the Victorian tradition of "benefit concerts", where the theatrical community came together to raise money for actors and actresses down on their luck or retiring.

The success of ''Trial by Jury'' spurred several attempts to reunite Gilbert and Sullivan, but difficulties arose.

JUDGE.
When I, good friends, was ,
    I'd an appetite fresh and hearty.
But I was, as many young s are,
    An impecunious party.
I'd a swallow-tail coat of a beautiful blue –
    A brief which I bought of a booby –
A couple of shirts, and a collar or two,
    And a ring that looked like a ruby!
CHORUS.
He'd a couple of shirts, and a collar or two,
And a ring that looked like a ruby.
JUDGE.
In  I danced a dance,
    Like a semi-despondent fury;
For I thought I never should hit on a chance
    Of addressing a British Jury –
But I soon got tired of third-class journeys,
    And dinners of bread and water;
So I fell in love with a rich attorney's
    Elderly, ugly daughter.
CHORUS.
So he fell in love, etc.

The curtain rises on the ,<ref>The "Court of the Exchequer extended its jurisdiction, a breach of promise [could be] tried there by the legal fiction that the wrong done to the plaintiff by the conduct of the defendant made her unable to pay her taxes" (Burgess, p. 38)</ref> where a jury and the public assemble to hear a case of  of marriage.   
]]
The Usher introduces the proceedings by exhorting the jury to listen to the broken-hearted Plaintiff's case but telling them that they "needn't mind" what the "ruffianly defendant" has to say.  He adds, however, that "From bias free of every kind, this trial must be tried!"  The Defendant (Edwin)<ref name=names>Edwin and Angelina were "a traditional pairing of names of faithful lovers" as far back in English literature as 's ''The Hermit'' and ''''. See {{cite book|last=Benford|first=Harry|year=1999|title=The Gilbert & Sullivan Lexicon, 3rd Revised Edition|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|publisher=The Queensbury Press|page=p. 18|isbn = 0-9667916-1-4}} and Bradley, p. 6, note to line 9</ref> arrives, and the jurymen greet him with hostility, even though, as he points out, they have as yet no idea of the merits of his case.  He tells them, with surprising candour, that he jilted the Plaintiff because she became a "bore intense" to him, and he then quickly took up with another woman.  The jurymen recall their own wayward youth, but they are now respectable gentlemen and no longer have any sympathy for the Defendant.
The Judge enters with great pomp and describes how he rose to his position&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;by courting a rich attorney's "elderly, ugly daughter".  The rich attorney then aided his prospective son-in-law's legal career until "at length I became as rich as the " and "threw over" the daughter.  The jury and public are delighted with the judge, and ignore that he has just admitted to the same wrong of which the Defendant is accused.<ref>"The irony of the situation will not go unperceived by the reader." - Burgess, p. 43</ref>
The jury is then sworn in, and the Plaintiff (Angelina)<ref name=names/> is summoned.  She is preceded into the courtroom by her bridesmaids, one of whom catches the eye of the judge.  However, when Angelina herself arrives in full wedding dress, she instantly captures the heart of both Judge and jury.  The Counsel for the Plaintiff makes a moving speech detailing Edwin's betrayal.  Angelina feigns distress and staggers, first into the arms of the Foreman of the Jury, and then of the Judge.  Edwin counters, explaining that his change of heart is only natural: 
<blockquote><poem>
"Oh, gentlemen, listen, I pray,
    Though I own that my heart has been ranging,
Of nature the laws I obey, 
    For nature is constantly changing. 
The moon in her phases is found, 
    The time and the wind and the weather, 
The months in succession come round, 
    And you don't find two Mondays together...." 
</poem></blockquote>
He offers to marry both the Plaintiff ''and'' his new love, if that would satisfy everyone.  The Judge at first finds this "a reasonable proposition", but the Counsel points out that it is "a rather serious crime / To marry two wives at a time".  Perplexed, everyone in court ponders the "nice dilemma" in a parody of Italian opera ensembles.<ref name=Bradley4>Bradley, p. 4</ref>  
Angelina desperately embraces Edwin, demonstrating the depth of her love, and bemoans her loss – all in evidence of the large amount of damages that the jury should force Edwin to pay.  Edwin, in turn, says he is a smoker, a drunkard, and a bully (when tipsy), and that the Plaintiff could not have endured him even for a day; thus the damages should be small.  The Judge suggests making Edwin tipsy to see if he would really "thrash and kick" Angelina, but everyone else (except Edwin) objects to this experiment.  Impatient at the lack of progress, the Judge resolves the case by offering to marry Angelina himself.  This is found quite satisfactory, and the opera is concluded with "joy unbounded".<ref>This synopsis is based on the libretto as printed in Bradley, pp. 7&ndash;39</ref>

Reviews of the first performance of ''Trial by Jury'' were uniformly glowing.  '''' magazine declared the opera "extremely funny and admirably composed",<ref>Allen (1958), p. 29</ref> while rival '''' magazine wrote that it "is the funniest bit of nonsense your representative has seen for a considerable time", only regretting that it was too short.<ref name=Allen30>Allen (1958), p. 30</ref>  The '''' praised the author: "In whimsical invention and eccentric humour Mr. W. S. Gilbert has no living rival among our dramatic writers, and never has his peculiar vein of drollery and satire been more conspicuous than in a little piece entitled ''Trial by Jury''".<ref name=Allen30/>  The '''' concluded that the piece illustrated the composer's "great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class".<ref name=Allen30/>  Many critics emphasised the happy combination of Gilbert's words and Sullivan's music.  One noted that "so completely is each imbued with the same spirit, that it would be as difficult to conceive the existence of Mr. Gilbert's verses without Mr. Sullivan's music, as of Mr. Sullivan's music without Mr. Gilbert's verses.  Each gives each a double charm."<ref>London's ''Daily News'', 27 March 1875, p. 3</ref>  Another agreed that "it seems, as in the great ian operas, as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain."<ref name=World226>[http://books.google.com/books?id=GZIPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA254&lpg=PA254&dq=%22Trial+by+Jury%22+Fisher+Sullivan+Bromley&source=web&ots=DjAOEqeye1&sig=tUvla3IBg6HkeOiWtxwk67ADC68&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result "''Trial by Jury''"], ''The Musical World'',  , p. 226.

As a boy I had such a musical bump,
    And its size so struck Mr. H<small>ELMORE</small>,
That he said, "Though you sing those songs like a trump,
    You shall write some yourself that will sell more."
So I packed off to Leipsic, without ''looking back,''
    And returned in such classical fury,
That I sat down with H<small>ANDEL</small> and H<small>AYDN</small> and B<small>ACH</small>,—
    And turned out "''Trial by Jury.''"
But  he jumped for joy
    As he said, "Though the job dismay you,
Send  to the deuce, my boy;
    It's the ''haul'' with me that'll pay you."
And we hauled so well, mid jeers and taunts,
    That we've settled, spite all temptations,
To stick to our Sisters and our Cousins and our Aunts,—
    And continue our pleasant relations.
</poem>
The opening night audience was also delighted by the piece, preferring it to even the Offenbach work: "To judge by the unceasing and almost boisterous hilarity which formed a sort of running commentary on the part of the audience, ''Trial by Jury'' suffered nothing whatever from so dangerous a juxtaposition [with a piece by the popular Offenbach].  On the contrary, it may fairly be said to have borne away the palm."<ref name=World226/>  A reviewer noted that "Laughter more frequent or more hearty was never heard in any theatre than that which more than once brought the action...&nbsp;to a temporary standstill."<ref>Allen (1958), p. 32</ref>  Another paper summed up its popular appeal: "''Trial by Jury'' is but a trifle&nbsp;–&nbsp;it pretends to be nothing more&nbsp;–&nbsp;but it is one of those merry bits of extravagance which a great many will go to see and hear, which they will laugh at, and which they will advise their friends to go and see, and therefore its success cannot be doubtful."<ref>''Quoted'' in Gänzl, p. 88</ref>
Among the actors, special critical praise was reserved for the composer's brother, Fred Sullivan, in the role of the Learned Judge: "The greatest 'hit' was made by Mr. F. Sullivan, whose blending of official dignity, condescension, and, at the right moment, extravagant humour, made the character of the Judge stand out with all requisite prominence, and added much to the interest of the piece."<ref>Allen (1958), p. 31, ''quoting'' the ''Daily Telegraph''</ref>  '''' concurred that his portrayal deserved "a special word of praise for its quiet and natural humour."<ref>Allen (1958), p. 31, ''quoting'' ''''</ref>  Nelly Bromley (the Plaintiff), Walter Fisher (the Defendant), John Hollingsworth (the Counsel) and others were also praised for their acting.<ref>Allen (1958), pp. 31&ndash;32</ref> 
Later assessments of the work have been no less positive.  In 1907, Gilbert's first biographer, Edith A. Browne, concluded:<Ref>Browne, p. 57</ref> "In ''Trial by Jury'' we find author and composer looking at the humorous side of life from exactly the same point of view, and we at once realise how Gilbert and Sullivan have been able to do for Comic Opera what Wagner has done for Grand Opera by combining words and music so as to make them one."  H. M. Walbrook similarly wrote in 1922:
Gilbert and Sullivan biographer Michael Ainger, writing in 2002, 127&nbsp;years after the premiere of the opera, explained its enduring appeal: "Nothing could be more serious than a court of law...&nbsp;and now the world had been turned upside down.  The court of law had become the scene of humor and frivolity; the learned judge had shown himself to be as fickle as the defendant, and the justice system turned out to be flawed by human frailty.  And Sullivan had grasped the joke....  From the first chords...&nbsp;Sullivan’s music sets the scene of mock-seriousness and proceeds to dance its way through the whole piece."<ref>Ainger, pp. 109&ndash;10</ref>{{-}}
As the first , ''Trial by Jury'' marked an important moment in the history of the Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration, as well as in the careers of each of the two men and in Victorian drama in general.  Historian Reginald Allen sums up the historical import of the opera:
Sidney Dark and Rowland Grey also give a high value to the importance of ''Trial by Jury'' and the operas that followed: "There is not a little historical interest in the genesis of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, the one English contribution of any value to dramatic literature for many generations."<ref>Dark and Grey, p. 68</ref>  In addition, references to the opera continue today in the popular media<ref>For example, in the British television show '''', starring , in the episode "Briefs Trooping Gaily", Kavanagh's colleague Jeremy Aldermarten () plays the Judge in an amateur production of ''Trial by Jury''.</ref> and even in law cases.<ref>For example, in the American law suit ''Askew v. Askew'', 22 Cal.App.4th 942 (4th Dist. 1994), the decision includes an extensive reference to ''Trial By Jury'' as an introduction to its discussion of suits for breach of promise and "the potential for abuse inherent in such lawsuits".</ref>
''Trial by Jury'' is the only Gilbert and Sullivan opera played in one act and the only theatrical work by W. S. Gilbert without spoken dialogue.<ref>Crowther, p. 77</ref> However, later Gilbert and Sullivan operas retained a number of patterns seen in ''Trial''.  For example, all except for '''' begin with a chorus number.<ref>Bradley, p. 758</ref>   Also, like ''Trial by Jury'', the later operas generally end with a relatively short finale consisting of a chorus number interspersed with short solos by the principal characters.  "Comes the broken flower" (part of No.&nbsp;3) was the first in a string of meditative "" lyrics, "mingling happiness and sadness, an acceptance and a smiling resignation".<ref>Stedman, p. 244</ref>  These would, from this point forward, allow the characters, in each of the Savoy operas, an introspective scene where they stop and consider life, in contrast to the foolishness of the surrounding scenes.<ref>Stedman, pp. 129&ndash;30, 244; Crowther, pp. 133&ndash;35</ref>  Like both of the tenor's arias in ''Trial by Jury'', tenor arias in later Savoy operas were set in  so frequently that comedienne , in her 1953 parody, "How to Write Your Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera",<ref>Recording and re-issue history available at: Shepherd, Marc (2002), [http://www.cris.com/~Oakapple/gasdisc/mdanna.htm "How to Write Your Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera (1953)"], ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'', Retrieved on  .</ref> exclaimed, "the tenor&nbsp;...&nbsp;according to tradition, ''must'' sing an aria in 6/8 time, usually accompanying himself on a stringed instrument".<ref>''Anna Russell Sings! Again?'' 1953 Columbia Masterworks Mono LP ML4594/ML4733</ref>  In ''Trial by Jury'' hypocrisy is revealed as the characters' motivations are held up to satire, and Gilbert mocks the underlying absurdity of the judicial procedures.  As Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther explains, Gilbert combines his criticisms with comic entertainment, which renders them more palatable, while at the same time underlining their truth: "By laughing at a joke you show that you accept its premise."<ref>Crowther, p. 78</ref> This too would become characteristic of Gilbert's work.<ref>Crowther, pp. 78&ndash;79</ref>
 as The Learned Judge]]
The judge's song, "When I, good friends, was called to the Bar" was followed by a string of similar s that would come to epitomise 's collaboration.<ref name=Bradley14>Bradley, p. 14</ref>  In these, often, a "dignified personage [would, just like the Judge,] supply a humorous biography of himself.<ref>Fitzgerald, pp. 25–26</ref>   Just as in Gilbert's earlier play, '''', in these songs, the characters "naïvely reveal their innermost thoughts, unconscious of their egotism, vanity, baseness, or cruelty".<ref><!-- NOTE! Crowther is applying Archer's ideas to ''Trial by Jury'' in this passage, so both references are needed. -->Crowther, p. 77, quoting Archer, p. 161</ref>  Crowther points out that such revelations work particularly well in ''Trial by Jury'', because people commonly expect "characters singing in opera/operetta will communicate at a deeper level of truth than they would in mere speech."<ref name=Crowther77/>  In "When I, good friends", the judge outlines the path of corruption that led to his becoming a judge, and this, too, would set the pattern for many of the patter songs in Gilbert and Sullivan operas to follow.<ref name=Crowther77 />
One of Gilbert's most notable innovations, first found in ''Thespis'' and repeated in ''Trial by Jury'' and all of the later Savoy operas, is the use of the chorus as an essential part of the action.  In most earlier operas, , and comedies, the chorus had very little impact on the plot and served mainly as "noise or ornament".<ref name=DarkGrey6768 />  In the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, however, the chorus is essential, taking part in the action and often acting as an important character in its own right.<ref name=DarkGrey6768>Dark & Grey, pp. 67&ndash;68</ref>  Sullivan recalled, "Until Gilbert took the matter in hand choruses were dummy concerns, and were practically nothing more than a part of the stage setting.  It was in 'Thespis' that Gilbert began to carry out his expressed determination to get the chorus to play its proper part in the performance.  At this moment it seems difficult to realise that the idea of the chorus being anything more than a sort of stage audience was, at that time, a tremendous novelty."<ref>Lawrence, pp. 85–86</ref>  Another Gilbert innovation, following the example of his mentor, , was that the costumes and sets were made as realistic as possible:<ref name=Stedman129>Stedman, p. 129</ref>  Gilbert based the scenery for the production on the  Sessions House, where he had practiced law in the 1860s.<ref>Dark & Grey, p. 65</ref>  The costumes were contemporary, and Angelina and her bridesmaids were dressed in real wedding attire.<ref name=Stedman129 />  This attention to detail and careful creation of realistic sets and scenes were typical of Gilbert's stage management and would be repeated in all of Gilbert's work.<ref>Crowther, p. 90</ref>  For instance, when preparing the sets for '''' (1878), Gilbert and Sullivan visited  to inspect ships.  Gilbert made sketches of the '''' and the '''' and created a model set for the carpenters to work from.<ref>Stedman, pp. 157–58; Crowther, p. 90</ref> This was far from standard procedure in Victorian drama, where naturalism was still a relatively new concept, and where most authors had very little influence on how their plays and libretti were staged.<ref>Crowther, pp. 87–89</ref>
Andrew Crowther places ''Trial by Jury'' at the centre of Gilbert's development as a librettist.  He notes that in some of Gilbert's early libretti, such as '''' (1874), the songs simply emphasise the dialogue.  In others, such as '''' (1871), some songs are relatively disconnected from both the story and characterisation, such as "I once knew a chap" or "Little maid of Arcadee", which simply convey a moral lesson.<ref>Crowther, pp. 76&ndash;77</ref>  In ''Trial by Jury'', however, each song carries the plot forward and adds depth to the characters.  In addition, unlike some of Gilbert's more fantastical early plots, "Aside from the ending, nothing essentially improbable happens."<ref name=Crowther77>Crowther, p. 77</ref>  Theatre historian  agrees, writing that "Gilbert's libretto was superior to any of his previous efforts.  It was concise, modern and satirical without being impossibly whimsical.  Having no spoken dialogue it was perforce tightly constructed and allowed of no interpolation or alteration."<ref>Gänzl, p. 88</ref>  Sullivan's development as a comic opera writer, too, would mature with ''Trial by Jury''.  Except for incidental music for productions of Shakespeare, he had not written any music for the stage since ''Thespis''.  Gänzl wrote that ''Trial by Jury'' "brought Sullivan firmly and finally into the world of the musical" stage<ref name=Ganzl89 /> and confirmed, after his previous success with '''' and ''Thespis'', that "Sullivan was a composer of light lyric and comic music who could rival Offenbach,  and any English musician alive."<ref name=Ganzl89>Gänzl, p. 89</ref> 
Sullivan used the opportunities suggested by Gilbert's satire of the pomp and ceremony of the law to provide a variety of musical jokes.<ref name=Bradley4/>  For example, ing the plaintiff's calculated swooning in "That she is reeling is plain to see!" (No.&nbsp;9) with a reeling,  theme in the string accompaniment, heading up and down (but mostly down) the s.<ref name=Ainger110/>  He underlines the Counsel's misstatement in the line "To marry two at once is burglaree" with a comic  "sting" in octaves.<ref name=Ainger110/>  The instruments are also used to comically set the scene; for instance, by having the Defendant tune his guitar on stage (simulated by a violin in the orchestra) in the opening to his song.<ref name=Bradley10>Bradley, p. 10</ref>  
The score also contains two parodies or pastiches of other composers: No.&nbsp;3, "All hail great Judge" is an elaborate parody of 's s,<ref>Bradley, pp. 4 and 12; Burgess, pp. 38&ndash;39</ref> and No.&nbsp;12, "A nice dilemma", parodies "dilemma" ensembles of Italian opera in the  era; in particular "D'un pensiero" from Act&nbsp;I of 's ''''.<ref>Bradley, p. 4; Burgess, p. 47</ref>  "A nice dilemma" uses the dominant rhythm and key of "D'un pensiero" and divides up some of the choral lines between the  and higher voices to create an ''oom-pa-pa'' effect common in Italian opera choruses.<ref>Jacobs, p. 91</ref>
After the premiere of ''Trial by Jury'' in 1875,  companies in London, the British provinces and elsewhere picked it up rapidly, usually playing it as a forepiece or an afterpiece to a French operetta.<ref name=Ganzl90>Gänzl, p. 90</ref>  The first American productions were at the Arch Street Theatre in  on   and the Eagle Theatre in  on  .<ref name=Ganzl95>Gänzl, p. 95</ref> The world tour of the original British production took it to America, Australia, and elsewhere.<ref>[http://www.library.rochester.edu/index.cfm?page=4089&Print=22 Theatre programme for Soldene English Opera Company's ''Trial by Jury'' at Boston's Globe Theatre],  , from online exhibition at University of Rochester Libraries.

Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies (of which there were often several playing simultaneously) usually programmed ''Trial by Jury'' as a companion piece to '''' or ''''.  From 1894, the year when the  established a year-round touring company that had most of the Gilbert and Sullivan works in its repertory, ''Trial by Jury'' was always included, except for 1901&ndash;03, and then again from 1943&ndash;46, when the company played a reduced repertory during .  ''Trial by Jury'' was eliminated in 1976 as a cost-saving measure.<ref>Bradley, p. 5</ref>

Starting in 1877, ''Trial by Jury'' was often given at benefit performances, usually for an actor or actress who had fallen on hard times, but occasionally for other causes. These were glittering affairs, with various celebrities appearing in principal roles or as part of the chorus.<ref>Burgess, pp. 52&ndash;54</ref> Gilbert himself played the silent role of the Associate on at least four occasions.<ref>Burgess, pp. 52&ndash;53; Gänzl, pp. 96&ndash;98</ref>  
Arthur Sullivan conducted the 1877 benefit for actor Henry Compton.<ref name=Ganzl96 />  At the Compton benefit, Penley and  were members of the Jury, and a number of other famous actors and actresses were in the chorus.<ref>Ainger, p. 130</ref>
At the  benefit, many of the performers listed below sat in the jury or the gallery, and ''Trial by Jury'' was followed by a six-hour long concert.

''Trial by Jury'' has been recorded many times.  Of the recordings by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, those recorded in 1927 and 1964 are ranked the best, according to "A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography", edited by Marc Shepherd.  The 1961 Sargent and the 1995 Mackerras recordings are also rated highly by the Discography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/tbj.htm |title=Recordings of Trial By Jury (1995)|author=Shepherd, Marc|publisher=A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography|accessdate=2008-06-01}}</ref>

Of the material cut before the first performance of ''Trial by Jury'', the most significant were two songs and a : a song for the foreman of the jury, "Oh, do not blush to shed a tear", which was to be sung just after "Oh, will you swear by yonder skies"; and a recitative for the Judge and song for the Usher, "We do not deal with artificial crime" and "His lordship's always quits", which came just before "A nice dilemma".<ref>Bradley, pp. 20, 32</ref> The melody for "His Lordship's always quits" is known, and it was reused in "I loved her fondly" in ''The Zoo'' and later modified into the main tune from "A wand'ring minstrel, I" in ''''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tillett, Selwyn|coauthors=Roderick Spencer|date=2002|title=Forty Years of ''Thespis'' Scholarship|url=http://www.chimesmusicaltheatre.co.uk/Thespis.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2006-05-25}} p. 11</ref>  A few changes were made to the end of "I love him, I love him!" after the first night.<ref>Bradley, p. 34</ref>  A third verse for "Oh, gentlemen, listen I pray" was sung, at least on the first night, and part was quoted in a review in the ''Pictorial World''.<ref>Allen (1975a), p. 42</ref>
''Trial by Jury'' underwent relatively minor textual changes after its first run, mainly consisting of insignificant amendments to wording.<ref>Bradley, pp. 6&ndash;38</ref>  The most significant changes involve the ending.  The original stage directions set up a simple -style tableau:
This became much more elaborate in the 1884 revival, with the entire set being transformed, and the plaintiff climbing onto the Judge's back "à la fairy".  However, in the 1920s, the plaster cupids were evidently damaged on a tour, and the transformation scene was abandoned completely.<ref name=Bradley38 />
