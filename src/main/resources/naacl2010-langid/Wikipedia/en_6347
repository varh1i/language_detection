The '''dachshund''' is a short-legged, elongated  of the  family.  The breed's name is  and literally means "badger dog," from ''(der) Dachs'', badger, and ''(der) Hund'', dog.   While classified as a hound in English speaking countries, some consider the classification to be in error, speculating that it arose from the fact that the German word ''hund'' is similar to the English word ''hound''. In fact many dachshunds, especially the wire haired sub type, exhibit behavior and appearance that is far more similar to the terrier group of dogs <ref>Nicholas, AK; Foy, MA (1987). ''The Dachshund.'' Neptune NJ: TFH Publications Inc. p 10 ISBN 0-86622-158-1</ref>. The standard size was developed to , , and flush s  and other burrow-dwelling animals, while the miniature was to hunt rabbits. Due to the long, narrow build, they are sometimes referred to as a '''wiener dog'''. Not withstanding the German origin of the dachshund's name, within German-speaking countries the breed is known&mdash;both formally and informally&mdash;as the '''Dackel''' or '''Teckel.'''

Dachshunds come in three sizes: standard and miniature,<ref name = "gkpnso">{{citeweb |url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/dachshund/index.cfm |title=Dachshund Breed Standard |publisher=American Kennel Club |accessmonthday=July 3 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> and ''kaninchen''.  Although the first two sizes are recognized almost universally, the third size (which means ''rabbit'') is recognized only by non-English speaking clubs like the  (FCI).

A full-grown standard dachshund averages {{convert|16|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|28|lb|abbr=on}}, while the miniature variety normally weighs less than {{convert|11|lb|abbr=on}}.  The kaninchen weighs {{convert|8|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10|lb|abbr=on}}.  According to most kennel club standards, the miniature (and kaninchen, where recognized) variety differs from the full-size only by size and weight, thus offspring from miniature parents must never weigh more than the miniature standard to be considered a miniature as well<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/dachshund/index.cfm |title=Dachshund Breed Standard |publisher=American Kennel Club |accessmonthday=July 23 |accessyear=2007}}</ref>.  While most kennel club size divisions use weight for classification, other kennel club standards determine the difference between the miniature and standard by chest circumference; some kennel clubs even measure chest circumference in addition to height and weight.
 said that "A dachshund is a half-dog high and a dog-and-a-half long," which is their main claim to fame, although many poems and songs refer to them as "two dogs long." This characteristic has led them to be quite a recognizable breed and featured in many a joke and cartoon, particularly '''' by .
Dachshunds exhibit three coat varieties, smooth coat, long hair and wire-hair. Wire hair is least commonly seen coat, and most recent coat to appear in breeding standards. Many people don't recognize wire-hairs as dachshunds and can be mistaken as other kinds of dogs<ref name = "gkpnso"/>.
Dachshunds have a wide variety of colors and patterns. They can be single colored, single colored with spots (or dappled) and single colored with tan points plus any pattern. The dominant color is red. It is the most common along with black and tan.  Two-colored dogs can be cream, blue, wild boar, chocolate brown, or fawn with "points", or markings over the eyes, ears, paws, and tail, of tan or cream.  A two-colored dachshund would be called by its dominant color first followed by the point color, such as "black and tan" or "chocolate and cream."  Other patterns include piebald, in which a white pattern is imposed upon the base color and/or any other pattern, and a lighter "boar" red<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://www.dachshund.org/Colors/breed_colors_patterns.html |title=Dachshund Colors and Patterns  |publisher=The Dachshund Magazine Online |accessmonthday=July 2 |accessyear=2007}}</ref>. The reds range from coppers to deep rusts, with somewhat common black hairs peppered along the back, tail, face, and ear edges, lending much character and an almost burnished appearance; this is often  desirable and is referred to among breeders and enthusiasts as a "stag" or an "overlay."
Solid black and solid chocolate-brown dachshunds occur and, even though dogs with such coloration are often considered handsome, the colors are nonstandard –  that is, the dogs are disqualified from  in the U.S. and Canada. Additionally, according to the Conformation judges of the DCA (Dachshund Club of America), and the AKC (American Kennel Club) assert the Piebald pattern a nonstandard<ref>http://www.doxiesrcool.com/Save-Piebalds</ref> and has voted to dismiss this pattern from competition.
Light-colored dachshunds can sport amber or green eyes, rather than brown; however kennel club standards state that the darker the eye color, the better. They can also have  eyes of two different colors; in rare cases, such as the double-dappled coloration (called  in other dog breeds<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://www.dachshund.org/article_double_dapple.html |title=The Double Dapple |publisher=The Dachshund Magazine Online |accessmonthday=June 25 |accessyear=2007}}</ref>), dachshunds can have a blue and brown eye. Blue eyes, partially blue eyes, or a blue eye and a brown eye are called "Wall" coloring.  Only the double dapple variety dachshunds can have blue or even partially blue eyes.  It is not considered a non-desirable trait in kennel club standards.  The standard was changed by the DCA in 2007 to exclude double dapples and changed single dapples to the only dapples. The reason is because the merle gene is linked to blindness and deafness.  Wall-eyed is permissible in single dapples.  It is impossible for a dachshund to have wall coloring without it being a double dapple. This is because when a dog receives a "dapple gene" from each parent, the genes can cross, washing out coloring within the eye.  Without the two dapple genes the crossing of such, blue or partially blue eyes cannot occur.
Dachshunds are  playful, fun dogs, known for their propensity to chase small animals, birds and tennis balls with great determination and ferocity. Many dachshunds are strong-headed or stubborn, making them a challenge to train. Dachshunds have been known to have a liking to dig holes in the garden, or chase small animals such as birds, squirrels, or lizards. They have a particularly loud bark, making dachshunds good watchdogs. Dachshunds are known for their devotion and loyalty to their owners, though they can be standoffish towards strangers. If left alone many dachshunds will whine until they have companionship. Some dachshunds are prone to separation anxiety and may chew objects in the house to relieve stress. 
According to the American Kennel Club’s breed standards, "the dachshund is clever, lively and courageous to the point of rashness, persevering in above and below ground work, with all the senses well-developed. Any display of shyness is a serious fault."<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/dachshund/index.cfm |title=Dachshund Breed Standard |publisher=American Kennel Club |accessmonthday=May 14 |accessyear=2007}}</ref> Their temperament and body language give the impression that they do not know or care about their relatively small size. Like many terriers, they think nothing of challenging a larger dog. Indulged dachshunds may become snappy<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://www.burkesbackyard.com.au/1999/archives/25/roadtests/dog_breeds/dachshunds |title=Dachshunds |publisher=Burke's Backyard with Don Burke |accessmonthday=May 14 |accessyear=2007}}</ref>.
The dachshund's temperament may vary greatly from dog to dog. Seemingly most dachshunds do not like unfamiliar people, and will growl or bark in response. Although the dachshund is generally an energetic dog, some are laid back. Due to this dog's behavior, it is not the dog for everyone. A bored dachshund will become destructive. If raised improperly, dachshunds can become aggressive or fearful. They require a caring owner that understands their need to have entertainment and exercise. Some may not be good with children, and they may bite an unfamiliar child. Others are tolerant and loyal to children within their family, but these children should be mindful of the breed's back and not carry them around roughly.
A 2008 University of Pennsyvania study of 6,000 dog owners who were interviewed indicated that smaller breed dogs were more likely to be “genetically predisposed towards aggressive behaviour.” Dachshunds were rated the most aggressive, with 20% having bitten strangers, as well as high rates of attacks on other dogs and their owners. The study noted that attacks by small dogs were unlikely to cause serious injuries and because of this were probably under-reported.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1032531/Why-sausage-dogs-really-just-legged-fiends.html Why Sausage dogs are really  just four-legged fiends]</ref>
The breed is known to have spinal problems, especially intervertebral disk disease (IVDD), due in part to an extremely long  and short rib cage<ref>V. F. Jensen, A. K. Ersbøll (2000) "Mechanical Factors affecting the Occurrence of Intervertebral Disc Calcification in the Dachshund - a Population Study", ''Journal of Veterinary Medicine Series'' A 47 (5), 283–296.</ref>. The risk of injury can be worsened by , which places greater strain on the e. In order to prevent injury, it is recommended that dachshunds be discouraged from jumping (something many seem to like doing anyway) and taking stairs, and encouraged to instead take the elevator (though some veterinarians say that slow stair-climbing is unlikely to lead to injury).   However, according to the same article above, dachshunds that climb stairs regularly may actually be less problematic probably because the exercise helps to keep them fitter and healthier, and positive correlations were found between physically fit dogs and a lower incidence of IVDD.  Hence the importance of keeping the dog at a good body weight. Holding the dog properly is also important, with both front and rear portions level. Under no circumstances should a dachshund be exposed to rough play or handling, as their spines may not tolerate such treatment.
As it has become increasingly apparent that the occurrence and severity of these spinal problems, or intervertebral disk disease, is largely hereditary, responsible breeders are working to eliminate this characteristic in the breed. Treatment consists of various combinations of crate confinement and courses of anti-inflammatory medications (steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like carprofen and meloxicam). Serious cases may require surgery to remove the troublesome disk contents<ref>Sarit Dhupa BVSc, Nita Glickman MS, MPH, David J. Waters DVM, PhD, Diplomate ACVS (1999)

A new minimally-invasive procedure called "percutaneous laser disk ablation" has been developed at the Oklahoma State University Veterinary Hospital<ref>http://www.vetmedpub.com/vetmed/On+the+Forefront/On-the-Forefront-Prophylactic-laser-disk-ablation-/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/440886?contextCategoryId=8701</ref>.

Since dachshunds are the poster children of dogs with back issues, the goal is to expand this treatment to dogs in a normal population.
In addition to back problems, the breed is also prone to .
 
Some double dapples have problems with deafness and blindness. Therefore they need an owner who understands a disabled dog's special needs.
Other health problems include hereditary , dental issues, ,  problems, various  and , and various eye conditions (, , , , ,  , , etc.).  It is important to buy from breeders who can guarantee that their stock are free from these genetic problems and whose dogs have been certified for eyes (esp in miniatures).
It is important to follow a good dental health regime, including an annual cleaning if possible.

Some have theorized that the early roots of the dachshund go back to , where engravings were made featuring short-legged hunting dogs<ref>M. Zedda, P. Manca, V. Chisu, S. Gadau, G. Lepore, A. Genovese, V. Farina (2006)
"Ancient Pompeian Dogs - Morphological and Morphometric Evidence for Different Canine Populations, Anatomia, Histologia, Embryologia", ''Journal of Veterinary Medicine'' Series C 35 (5), 319–324. </ref>. Recent discoveries by the  of mummified dachshund-like dogs from ancient Egyptian burial urns may lend credibility to this theory. But in its modern incarnation, the dachshund is a creation of an , and includes elements of , , and  hounds and s. Dachshunds have been kept by royal courts all over Europe, including that of , who was particularly enamored of the breed.  They were originally bred for hunting badgers by trailing them.
The first verifiable references to the dachshund, originally named the "Dachs Kriecher" (badger crawler) or "Dachs Krieger" (badger warrior), came from books written in the early 1700s. Prior to that, there exist references to "badger dogs" and "hole dogs", but these likely refer to purposes rather than to specific breeds. The original German dachshunds were larger than the modern full-size variety, weighing between 30 and 40 lb. (14 to 18 kg), and originally came in straight-legged and crook-legged varieties (the modern dachshund is descended from the latter). Though the breed is famous for its use in exterminating badgers and , dachshunds were also commonly used for  and  hunting, for locating wounded , and in packs were known to hunt game as large as  and as fierce as the .
Double-dapple dachshunds are prone to eye disease and therefore are rare. It is generally believed that the breed was introduced to the United States between 1879 and 1885
The flap-down ears and famous curved tail of the dachshund have deliberately been bred into the dog.  In the case of the ears, this is so that grass seeds, dirt and other matter do not enter into the ear canal.  The curved tail is dual-purposed: to be seen more easily in long grass and, in the case of burrowing dachshunds, to help haul the dog out if it becomes stuck in a burrow.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

Dachshunds have traditionally been viewed as a symbol of Germany, despite their pan-European heritage. ists commonly used the image of the dachshund to ridicule . During  the dachshunds' popularity in the United States plummeted because of this association. There were numerous reported incidents across America of dachshunds being killed due to their perceived German heritage. The stigma of the association was revived to a lesser extent during , though it was comparatively short-lived. German Field Marshal  was known for keeping dachshunds. 
Due to the association of the breed with Germany, the dachshund was chosen to be the first official  for the , with the name .
Some people train and enter their dachshund to compete in , such as the Wiener Nationals. Several races across the country routinely draw several thousand attendees, including races in ; ; ; ; ; ; ; and . Despite the popularity of these events, the Dachshund Club of America opposes "wiener racing", as many greyhound tracks use the events to draw large crowds to their facilities. The DCA also is worried about potential injuries to dogs, due to their predisposition to back injuries. 
Another favorite sport is s, in which dachshunds enter tunnels with dead ends and obstacles attempting to locate an artificial bait or live but caged and protected mice. Dachshunds, being true s, also compete in , with a national championship sponsored every year by the DCA.
In Germany dachshunds are widely named as 'Dackel' (both singular and plural). To be classified as a full Teckel, these dogs must undergo  tests. Classically, any dog of dackel heritage is given an official tattoo upon one ear. After suitable training, the dog must then follow a blood trail that is at least 48 hours old successfully to its conclusion. Once this is completed, another tattoo is marked on the other ear to denote full Teckel rank. As 'Teckel' are bred for hunting purposes, teckels tattooed or not, tend to be visibly larger in their chests than their dackel counterparts, though marginally shorter in length.
