In , '''Church's thesis''' refers to the mathematical assertion that all total functions are . It gets its name after the informal , which states that every  is in fact a , but the two are different. One way it can be formally stated is the schema
<math>(\forall x \exist y \; \phi(x,y)) \to (\exist f \; \forall x \exist y,u \; \bold{T}(f,x,y,u) \wedge \phi(x,y))</math>
for any predicate <math>\phi</math>, and the variables range over the s. This schema asserts that, if for every ''x'' there is a ''y'' satisfying some predicate, then there is in fact an ''f'' which is the  of a general recursive function which will, for every ''x'', produce such a ''y'' satisfying that predicate. ('''''T''''' is some universal predicate which decodes the Godel-numbering used.)
The thesis is incompatible with , since adding it to  allows one to disprove instances of the . However, Heyting arithmetic is  with  as well as with Heyting arithmetic plus Church's thesis. That is, adding either the law of the excluded middle or Church's thesis does not make Heyting arithmetic inconsistent, but adding both does.
An extended version of Church's thesis makes the same assertion for total functions whose domain are certain s of the natural numbers. It is used by the school of constructive mathematics founded by .
