In Japanese poetry, {{nihongo|'''honkadori'''|本歌取り|}} is an allusion to another older poem that would be generally recognized by its potential readers. The honkadori possesses qualities of  and  in Japanese art.  The concept emerged in the 12th century during the .  Honkadori is one of the many terms in Japanese poetry used to describe , another being . 
This style of quoting is a common trope in many ancient Japanese works of literature including stories such as the  and poems such as those found in the  and the . 
In a narrative story, honkadori are often found in the form of a poem spoken by one of the characters.  In a  poem, this is usually the first line of the poem. A honkadori is not merely a reference to another poem even though lines are sometimes copied word for word.  The use of honkadori attempts to affect the reader in the same way as the original poem and the only difference being in the meaning and the atmosphere.  Debates occur while interpreting poems over the difference between honkadori and seishi, lines from poetry which have already been used and are not allowed to be repeated).  
Because poetry in Japan was usually written for uta-awase, or poetry competitions, a “good” poem was not merely one that expressed emotions in a unique and beautiful way. Instead, poets were judged on their mastery of using their knowledge of existing poems and the way in which they placed honkadori and other poetic tropes into their poems.

Fujiwara no Teika's interpretation of the honkadori only applied to a selective audience of aristocrats and members of the Japanese court who were well versed on all Japanese poetry and tropes.  Therefore, for Fujiwara no Teika the honkadori’s context and use were dependent on the reader.  The skillful use of the honkadori is then found in the balance between not being plagiarism, and still evoking the context of the original poem.
