He met and married Margrit Hüssy in 1914. In 1925, the couple legally combined their names.<ref>In Germany, their family name became "Rosenstock-Hüssy." In the United States, it was adapted to English spelling as "Rosenstock-Huessy." Published references in this article use the latter spelling.</ref> They had a son, Hans, in 1921. Rosenstock-Huessy served in . He wrote extensively about public law, history, philosophy, sociology, and religion until he and his wife emigrated to the United States in 1933. In the United States, Rosenstock-Huessy began to use the English spelling of the hyphenated name professionally.
Until his retirement in 1957, Rosenstock-Huessy was a professor at , where he taught  and wrote extensively. Rosenstock-Huessy may be best known as the close friend and correspondent of . Their exchange of letters is considered by social scholars to be indispensable in the study of the modern encounter of s with . He developed , a new approach to characterizing and understanding the social sciences, based on language and on the spoken word, which used grammar as a method to analyze issues in the social sciences. His work combined Christianity with philosophy, labor practices, education, the social sciences, social history, and voluntary work service. Subsequent scholars have found much of what he wrote about human culture to be insightful and prophetic.
Rosenstock-Huessy was born Eugen Friedrich Moritz Rosenstock in ,  on , , to Theodor and Paula Rosenstock. His father, a scholarly man, was a banker and a member of the . He was the only son among seven surviving children.
Despite his parents’ ish heritage, his family “celebrated some Christian holidays, in keeping with other German families at the time.” <ref>{{Harvnb|Argo Books, Inc.|1999|p= }}</ref>  He joined the  at age 17 and was christened at age 18. He remained a devout proponent of Christianity throughout the rest of his life.
After graduating from a secondary school () with very high academic standards and an emphasis on classical languages and literature, Rosenstock-Huessy pursued law studies at the universities of , , and . In 1909 the University of Heidelberg granted him a doctorate in law. In 1912 he became a '''', a preliminary qualification to becoming a professor, at the , where he taught constitutional law and the history of law until 1914.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1990|p= }}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|von Moltke|Huessy|Stahmer|1999|p= }}</ref>
In 1914 Rosenstock-Huessy visited ,  to conduct historical research. There he met Margrit Hüssy, a Swiss art history major. They married later that year.  broke out shortly thereafter.
At the onset of , the German Army drafted Rosenstock-Huessy and stationed him at , including 18 months at , until the war’s end. “During this period he organized courses for the troops, replacing the limited instruction in patriotism with broader topics. In 1916, he and his friend, the Jewish philosopher Franz Rosenzweig, also on active duty, exchanged letters on Judaism and Christianity.” <ref>{{Harvnb|von Moltke|Huessy|Stahmer|1999|p= }}</ref>.  That correspondence has become well known as a dialog between proponents of the two related religions. Rosenstock-Huessy’s work, ''Judaism Despite Christianity'', <ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock|Rosenzweig|1969|p= }}</ref>.  contains much of this correspondence. <ref>{{Harvnb|von Moltke|Huessy|Stahmer|1999|p= }}</ref>
After World War I, Rosenstock-Huessy became active in labor issues, focusing on improving education as a means to improve the societal standard of living. He returned to academia and started publishing his first noted works.
Rosenstock-Huessy did not return to his teaching post at the University of Leipzig. Instead, he obtained a position with Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (Daimler Motor Company), the German car manufacturer, in , Germany. In 1919, he founded and became the editor until 1921 of the first factory newspaper in Germany, the Daimler ''Werkzeitung'' (Work Newspaper).<ref>{{Harvnb|Daimler-Benz AG|1991|p= }}</ref> 
In 1921, Rosenstock founded ''Die Akademie der Arbeit'' (the Academy of Labor) in Frankfurt/Main. “This institution offered courses and seminars for blue-collar workers, but he resigned in 1923 over differences with the trade union representatives. Nevertheless, he did not give up his involvement with adult education and his efforts to give industrial workers a voice of their own in society.” He co-founded the [http://www.patmos.de/ Patmos Verlag] publishing house, which published works on “new religious, philosophical, and social perspectives.”<ref>{{Harvnb|Argo Books, Inc.|1999|p= }}</ref>
In 1923, Rosenstock-Huessy received a second doctorate in philosophy from the University of Heidelberg. He then lectured at the  in the faculty of social science and social history until he was offered a job at the  as a full professor of German legal history, a position he held from 1923 until , .

During this period, Rosenstock-Huessy became active in many other ways at the University of Breslau. He helped organize voluntary work service camps&mdash; ''Löwenberger Arbeitslager'' ( Work Camp) &mdash;for students, young farmers, and young workers to address the living and labor conditions at coal mines in , . <ref>{{Harvnb|von Moltke|Huessy|Stahmer|1999|p= }}</ref> 
In 1926, , a reform-minded Roman Catholic priest, was excommunicated and thus lost his right to teach church history at the University of Breslau.<ref>{{Harvnb|German Wikipedia|2008|p= }}</ref>  Rosenstock-Huessy stood by his friend, Wittig, in this affair. In 1927-1928, they co-authored ''Das Alter der Kirche'' (''The Age of the Church''), which contained two volumes of essays on the history of the Church and a third volume devoted to documents leading up to Wittig’s excommunication.<ref>{{Harvnb|von Moltke|Huessy|Stahmer|1999|p= }}</ref> 
In 1925, he co-founded a journal, ''Die Kreatur'' (''The Creature''), which was edited by Wittig, a Roman Catholic; , a Jew; and , a Protestant, and lasted until 1930. “Among the contributors were , , , , , Rudolf Hallo, and Florens Christian Rang. Each of these men had, between 1910 and 1932, in one way or another, offered an alternative to the idealism, positivism, and historicism that dominated German universities.” <ref>{{Harvnb|Argo Books, Inc.|1999|p= }}</ref>  
Soon after , , when the  (Nazis) assumed power in Germany, Rosenstock-Huessy resigned from the University of Breslau and departed Germany that year. By the end of 1933, he received an appointment as Lecturer in German Art and Culture at  with the help of a professor of government there. <ref>{{Harvnb|Argo Books, Inc.|1999|p= }}</ref>
Rosenstock-Huessy published his medieval study ''Königshaus und Stämme in Deutschland zwischen 911 und 1250'' (''The Royal House and the Tribes in Germany between 911 and 1250'') <ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock|1914|p= }}</ref> in , which he had written in Leipzig and was the source of recognition for his second doctorate. In 1920, Rosenstock-Huessy published ''Die Hochzeit des Krieges und der Revolution'' (''The Marriage of War and Revolution''), <ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock|1920|p= }}</ref> “a collection of current events essays that were replete with visionary thinking and practical warnings of conflicts to come.” <ref>{{Harvnb|Argo Books, Inc.|1999|p= }}</ref>   In 1921, Rosenstock-Huessy published ''Angewandte Seelenkunde'' (''Practical Knowledge of the Soul'') <ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock|1921|p= }}<br /> Alternative translation: ''Practical Knowledge of the Soul''</ref> wherein he developed a new method for the social sciences based on language, the spoken word, and his "grammatical approach." He later called this approach "metanomics."<ref>{{Harvnb|von Moltke|Huessy|Stahmer|1999|p= }}</ref>   Together with Josef Wittig, a , he published ''Das Alter der Kirche'' (''The Age of the Church'') <ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock|Wittig|1928|p= }}</ref> in 1927-28. That work contained two volumes of essays on the life of the Church and a third volume devoted to documents leading up to Wittig’s excommunication.” <ref>{{Harvnb|von Moltke|Huessy|Stahmer|1999|p= }}</ref> 
“While he was still teaching at Breslau, Rosenstock wrote and published the first of his major works: ''Die Europäischen Revolutionen: Volkscharaktere und Staatenbildung'' (''The European s and the Character of Nations; 1931''). <ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock-Huessy|1931|p= }}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock-Huessy|1951|p= }}</ref> This book showed how 1,000 years of European history had been created from five different European national revolutions that collectively came to an end in World War I.” <ref>{{Harvnb|von Moltke|Huessy|Stahmer|1999|p= }}</ref>
Rosenstock-Huessy encountered strong opposition at Harvard University to the presentation of his ideas in social history and other topics, all of which were based on his Christian faith. Reportedly, Rosenstock-Huessy frequently mentioned God in class. He also often attacked pure, objective academic thinking, a teaching tradition assumed by the Harvard faculty to be a prerequisite for high scholarship. These attacks grated on the secular beliefs of other Harvard faculty members. Profound differences of opinion ensued and led, in 1935, to his accepting an appointment as professor of social philosophy at  in . He made his home in nearby . He taught at Dartmouth until his retirement in 1957. <ref>{{Harvnb|Argo Books, Inc.|1999|p= }}</ref> 
At Harvard, he had made friends there who helped him in his publishing efforts. His first major writing task was to develop an English-language revision of his earlier book on revolutions, and he soon published ''Out of Revolution: Autobiography of Western Man'' <ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock-Huessy|1938|p= }}</ref> in 1938. George Allen Morgan, a former Harvard student under Alfred North Whitehead and himself the author of the classic ''What Nietzsche Means'', subsequently assisted Rosenstock-Huessy in the preparation of ''The Christian Future or the Modern Mind Outrun'' <ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock-Huessy|1938|p= }}</ref> in 1946. Further, Whitehead had strongly supported Rosenstock-Huessy in his disagreements with members of the Harvard faculty. <ref>{{Harvnb|Argo Books, Inc.|1999|p= }}</ref> 
In 1940 he presented a request to , , and was granted approval to organize a youth training program for the  (CCC).  and journalist  were champions of the proposal. He then founded  in ,  as a prototype for a national peacetime volunteer labor service. “Involving mainly students from Dartmouth, Radcliffe, and Harvard, its purpose was to train young leaders to expand the 7-year-old CCC from a program for unemployed youth into a work service program that would accept volunteers from all walks of life.”<ref>{{Harvnb|Argo Books, Inc.|1999|p= }}</ref> , The entrance of the United States into  in 1941 ended this and all other CCC programs because men were needed in the armed services and women became a greater part of the workforce. This concept anticipated the  by more than two decades.

After World War II and continuing through his retirement from Dartmouth, Rosenstock-Huessy was a frequent guest professor at many universities in Germany and the United States. He remained active in lecturing and writing until his final years. His output comprises more than 500 essays, articles, and monographs, as well as 40 books.
