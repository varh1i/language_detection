The '''Women's World Golf Rankings''', also known for sponsorship reasons as the ''' Rankings''', were introduced in February .  They are sanctioned by the five main women's   and the organisations behind them:  (), , , , and , and also by the , which administers the . 
The idea of introducing a set of women's rankings similar to the  for men was developed at the May 2004 World Congress of Women's Golf, and was first planned for 2005,<ref name="rankingsplanned">

The rankings are based on performances on the five major tours and the , the official developmental tour of the LPGA, over a two-year period. Amateur players are eligible. The system for calculating the rankings is similar to that for the men's Official World Golf Rankings. Players receive points for each good finish on the relevant tours, with the number of points available in each event depending on the strength of the field, as determined by the competitors' existing rankings (when the rankings were introduced rankings were calculated for earlier periods; indeed the first ever set showed notional changes since the previous week). The only exceptions are the four  and Futures Tour events, which have a fixed-point allocation. Rankings are tapered so the recent results are more important. 
When the rankings were first introduced in February 2006, a player's ranking as calculated in the above description was divided by the number of events played, with a minimum required events of 15 over the previous two years.  In addition, players were required to play in a minimum of 15 eligible events over the previous two-year period in order to be included in the rankings.
On August 2, 2006 the Rolex Rankings Board and Technical Committee announced following its bi-annual meeting two changes to the ranking formula.<ref name="aug2006rev">

Many commentators saw the latter change as directed at , who at the time was ranked second in the world despite having competed in only 16 women's professional events in the two-year period.  However, the chairman of the Rolex Rankings Technical Committee defended the change as one designed to make the women's rankings more comparable to the  for men, which use a minimum divisor of 40 events.
On April 16, 2007, another modification in the formula was introduced. Instead of points being awarded on an accumulated 104-week rolling period, with the points awarded in the most recent 13-week period carrying a stronger value, points began to be reduced in 91 equal decrements following week 13 for the remaining 91 weeks of the two-year Rolex Ranking period rather than the seven equal 13 week decrements previously used.<ref name="apr162007rev">

</ref> This modification did not have an immediate impact on the rankings.
When they were introduced the rankings attracted considerable criticism on two grounds. [http://golf.about.com/b/a/245967.htm]  First, it was widely felt that members of the LPGA of Japan Tour were ranked too high, since few of them had competed successfully outside Japan. Second, the minimum of 15 events needed to qualify for a ranking was widely seen as having been selected purely to enable  to be highly ranked because she had played exactly that number in the preceding two years, while every other highly ranked player had played many more events. If the women's rankings used the same system used for the men's rankings â€“- that is a minimum number of events of one but a minimum denominator of 40 to calculate the average points per tournament -- Wie would have been just outside the top 10. But under the women's ranking system where only players who had played a minimum number of events were included, if the minimum number of events had been set higher than fifteen, Wie would not have been ranked at all.
The August 2006 revised formula addresses the second criticism.  The technical committee that administers the rankings urged patience with regard to the first criticism, since the continuing "strength of the field" weighting of tournaments may correct the issue without any technical changes being made.
The rankings will be used by each of the sponsoring tours to determine eligibility criteria for certain events. On the LPGA Tour, they will be one of the entry criteria for the , the , and the , where they are also used for seeding the 64-player qualifying field.  They will be used to select players for the , and from 2007 four of the 12 places in the European  team will be allocated on the basis of the rankings.
