'''Thelytoky''' or thelytokous  is a type of parthenogenesis in which females are produced from unfertilized eggs. It is rare in the  and has only been reported in about 1500 .<ref>White M (1984).

Thelytoky can occur by a number of different mechanisms each of which has a different impact on the level of .  
An example of thelytoky is the reproduction of female s or s by s.  It occurs in the Cape bee, '''' and has been found in other strains at very low frequency. In s, thelytoky occurs when diploidy is restored by the fusion of two meiotic products.<ref>E. Baudry et al.

''Genetics'' 167:243-252</ref> Usually, unfertilized eggs are haploid containing only a single set of chromosomes (16) from the mother.  Cape bee laying workers are capable of laying unfertilized diploid (32 chromosomes) eggs. These eggs undergo an unusual .  One stage during  is  when the chromosomes separate.  In  (the reproduction without male ), anaphase is followed by fusion of two meiotic products to restore egg diploidy (the egg  and the central descendant of the first  fuse to form a diploid nucleus called ). Depending on how the  (diploid egg) is fed it can develop into a worker bee or a queen bee.
