An '''injection-locked oscillator''' ('''ILO''') is usually based on cross-coupled  . It has been employed for frequency division <ref>M.

It was employed in continuous mode clock and data recovery (CDR) or  to perform clock restoration from the aid of either preceding pulse generation circuit to convert non-return-to-zero (NRZ) data to pseudo-return-to-zero (PRZ) format<ref> M.

The operation of ILO is based on the fact that the local oscillation can be locked to the frequency and phase of external injection signal under proper conditions.
