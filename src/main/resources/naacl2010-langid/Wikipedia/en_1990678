'''Self Nomination''' I started this article in conjuction with .  Since then at least a dozen people have improved it.  After I put the finishing touches on this article I decided to nominate it here.  It covers everything on the topic.  And I mean everything.  I don't think any new content can be added here.  This shows wikipedia's uniqueness greatly.  I was only able to find one other page on the entire net descibing this device.  It is well written, perfectly formatted.  Fit style, is fully wikified, and is well written.  If this article becomes featured, it will also, add to our FA diversity, as no Stargate articles are featured yet.  Stargate is a very popular show, and this article represents the device described in it very nicely.   04:25, 11 January 2006 (UTC)
