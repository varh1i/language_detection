I know Japan is technological, but I don't think Flash is exactly "traditional". (That is the flash it is talking about, no?). And I damn dissapointed there wasn't at least an external link... -- 13:39, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)
'''Delete'''; managed to find a non- reference ; but the article isn't really much help.  14:38, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)
This page is now preserved as an archive of the debate and, like some other VfD subpages, is no longer 'live'. Subsequent comments on the issue, the deletion, or the decision-making process should be placed on the relevant 'live' pages. '''Please do not edit this page'''.
