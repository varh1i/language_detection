The '''Aviafiber Canard 2FL''' was a one-person recreational aircraft of highly unusual design. Variously described as a rigid-wing hang-glider or as a foot-launched sailplane, it was the brainchild of Swiss aerodynamicist . Of fibreglass construction, it consisted of a tiny fuselage, just big enough to accommodate the pilot in a prone position, and provided with doors in the bottom through which the pilot's feet could protrude for takeoff and landing. A large  was fitted at the nose (as the name suggests), and the main lifting surfaces were supported atop a tall, V-shaped pylon. 
A pilot was killed flying the aircraft; business partners withdrew the Canard 2FL from sale and bought back the small number that had already been sold.
