This event had a total attendance of 125,000 visitors.<ref>Dorpat reports this number but describes it as "an estimate inflated, perhaps, with euphoria".</ref> Amidst the local economic depression triggered by the near collapse of , the festival attempted to revive local spirits, and was the largest event held in  since the . Liberal talk radio host Irving Clark Jr. chaired the fair committee, and avant-garde impressario Anne Focke used one-fifth of that for s (which incorporated s, still something of a novelty at that time), , enormous inflatable soft sculptures by the Land Truth Company, and an electronic jam session. Other events included dance, theater, folk music, arts and crafts, s, , a Miss Hot Pants Contest, amateur motorcycle races, and one out-of-town performer:  singer .<ref name=historylink />
In 1972, "Festival '72", held on –23, took in 175,000 guests.<ref name=historylink /> In 1973 the festival adopted the present name "Bumbershoot", grew to five days, and pulled in 200,000 visitors. National acts included , , and . In 1974 it grew again, to 10 days and 325,000 visitors. The festival opened with a "Renaissance Processional" for the kilometer or so from downtown to the center; Mayor  and most of the city council participated that year, in roles ranging from ing to reading children's stories aloud to, in the mayor's case, running the Lost Child Center.<ref name=historylink /> Another prominent Bumbershoot event from this era was the Bumbernationals Artists' , which continued into the early 1980s.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} 1975's 11-day festival was produced by Parks Department employee John Chambless, a former  professor of history and philosophy who had produced the 1968 ,<ref name=historylink /> the 's most prominent -era festival.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}
With declining government grant support, Bumbershoot tried to keep afloat on donations and sales of posters, buttons, and T-shirts, but poor weather hurt attendance some years and left the free Festival scrambling for more financially stable options.<ref name=historylink />
First, the festival retrenched on the number of days and on bringing in national talent. According to John Chambless, about 25 percent of the 1975 budget went to out-of-town talent; the 1976  festival was nearly 100 percent local and was cut to two weekends; in 1977, it was further cut to just Labor Day weekend; as it happened, in both 1977 and 1978, Labor Day weekend was rainy.<ref name=historylink />
In 1980 the city brought in Northwest non-profit organization One Reel to produce the event; they have been running it ever since,<ref name="online-history">[http://www.bumbershoot.com/history.htm Bumbershoot History], official Bumbershoot site. Accessed online  .</ref> a mid-1980s attempt by Seattle Center itself to wrest back control was overruled by the City Council. As the One Reel Vaudeville Show, they had been involved in the event since its second year, 1972, but with their new role as festival producer came big change. Once again the festival again featured headlining national and international talent (acts that year included , , the , , ,  and ), but added an admission charge. Initially that admission charge was US$2.50 a day<ref name=historylink /> (although there a "Free Friday",<ref name=historylink /> tradition lasted for over a decade{{Fact|date=September 2007}}); as of 2007, it has grown to US$35 a day.<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/musicnightlife/2003866215_bumberside03.html?syndication=rss Bumbershoot Basics], ''Seattle Times'', , .

The new formula featured world-class acts while continuing to ground the festival on a bedrock of  talent. Record numbers of art and music lovers flocked to the 15 stages, galleries, outdoor venues and food, art and craft vendors. Artists such as , ,  and  shared the turf with art oddities like the gigantic flying pencil, the Bumbernationals soapbox derby and robotic art.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} Although initially resistant to , in the mid-'90s Bumbershoot introduced some of the first large-scale  shows ever held in Seattle, a tradition that's still very much alive in 2007. From the ashes of the  scene came a new brand of Seattle sound; influential alternative rock bands such as , , and  have played Bumbershoot.
In the new millennium, international artists have included groups such as , The Grand  Theatre of Japan, and an Ethiopian youth circus. The One Reel Film Festival, held within Bumbershoot, celebrates American independent film shorts. Bumbershoot incorporated new arts forms such as s and  as well as older arts such as circus, contortion, aerial, and street theater.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}
As the largest single showcase for regional talent, Bumbershoot became a cultural tastemaker. The festival—which has become Seattle's longest-lived music and arts festival—paved the way for other Seattle-area outdoor events, festivals, and happenings. Many of these, such as the  that premiered at Seattle Center on  weekend the following year, have become established traditions in their own right.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}.
