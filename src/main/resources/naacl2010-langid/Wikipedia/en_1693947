''The Red Notebook'' is a collection of stories written by  author  in four parts. ''The Red Notebook'' in 1992, ''Why Write?'' in 1995, ''Accident Report'' in 1999 and ''It Don't Mean a Thing'' in 2000. They are all true stories gathered from Auster's life as well as the lives of his friends and acquaintances and they have all one thing in common: the paradox of coincidence. Auster narrates things he writes about in his fiction, making us wonder if he's really telling us the truth. Implying that everything and everyone is somehow, mysteriously, connected to each other.  
Auster tells us about the wrong number that inspired him to write ''City of Glass'', about how he met his childhood hero , but didn't have a pencil with him to get his autograph and how during all four flat tires of his life he had the same passenger in the car with him.
