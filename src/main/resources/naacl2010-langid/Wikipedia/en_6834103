I think this is likely, but there's really nothing I can do about it.  Catacalisma has been warned and has not edited since then.  If he adds vandalism again, especially if it's insulting to real people, then he should be blocked without further warning.  Otherwise, let it be.  Edits by the anonymous IP addresses are too old for preventative blocks to do any good.  ( â€¢ ) 03:48, 9 May 2008 (UTC)
