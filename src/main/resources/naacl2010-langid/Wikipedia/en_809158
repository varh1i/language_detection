The '''Anthorn Transmitting Station''' is located near , ,  and is operated by . It has two transmitters: one  and one .
The characteristic triangular pattern of roads, clearly visible on the {{mmuknr photo|317950|558150|10|aerial photograph}}, is a remnant from the  military airfield which was operated by the  as ''HMS Nuthatch''.
The VLF transmitter is used primarily for transmitting orders to submarines on 19.6 kHz. Its  is .
It is a  facility, controlled from  along with three other VLF transmitters in Norway, Germany and Italy.<ref>{{cite web
The  (NPL) has installed three s at Anthorn and on   , retaining their original call sign of MSF, were transferred there on a trial basis, moving formally on  .  Monitoring and logging of the clocks and control of the transmissions is by internet link from the NPL offices at , using comparison with  signals at both locations. Signal monitoring is by radio. To ensure accuracy, dynamic adjustment of the aerial according to local conditions (such as wind distortion) is controlled from computers on site.<ref>{{cite web
