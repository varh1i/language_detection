'''Roughness length''' (<math>z_0</math>) is a  which is a measure of terrain roughness as "seen by" surface wind. It is formally the height (in meters) at which the wind speed becomes zero when the  above the roughness sub-layer is extrapolated to zero wind speed. In fact, the roughness length lies within the roughness sub-layer, where the wind speed deviates from the . This parameter represents the bulk effect of roughness elements in the  and very approximately has a value of around 0.1 times the height of the roughness elements.
