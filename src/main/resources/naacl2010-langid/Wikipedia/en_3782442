- I believe the Captain should be re-put, for the reasons i stated on the talk page of the article. I am not from a porn company, i merely tried to add an informative article on the subject of a porn start who is notable amongst young men, particularly college students. The Captain is notable for these reasons, and the article therefore conforms to wiki policy. {{Unsigned|Captainstabbin}}

With sorrow I see this category suddenly deleted. The  shows total lack of understanding what part of society Muslim women are. Even the sole person who voted to keep shows lack of unrerstanding by writing "It was created to break the Muslim category in half". This category "breaks in half" in the same was as  or  break the larger ones in half. The fact is that the visibility of women in Muslim society has been so low that notable Muslim women are notable twice, and they most surely deserve a separate category.
