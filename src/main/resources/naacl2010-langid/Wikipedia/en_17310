The Oromo are one of the  speaking groups of people living in Eastern and North Eastern Africa. Cushitic speakers have inhabited parts of north-eastern and eastern Africa for as long as recorded history. Oromos are found predominantly in Ethiopia (99%), but are spread from as far as northern Ethiopia (southern ) to (mainly northern) Kenya, even as far south as . The Oromo represent one of largest of the Cushitic groups inhabiting the Horn of Africa. Their physical features, culture, language and other evidences unequivocally point to the fact that they are indigenous to this part of Africa. Available information clearly indicates that the Oromo existed as a community of people for thousands of years in East Africa (Prouty at al, 1981). Bates (1979) contends, "The Gallas [''''] were a very ancient race, the indigenous stock, perhaps, on which most other peoples in this part of eastern Africa have been grafted".
While further research is needed to precisely comprehend the origin of Oromo people, it is well known that Oromo people come from a line of pastoralist/nomadic group and/or semi-agriculturalist group. It is likely that they have existed for a longer period of time side by side with their northern -speaking neighbors. There is a wealth of oral history that describe interactions between the two group dating back as early as the 6th century. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}. 
During the 16th century, following the wars between the kingdom of  and the neighboring , which resulted in the exhaustion of both states, Oromos moved north into their territories. The Ethiopian monk , writing in 1593, attributed the Oromo success to the existence of too many non-fighting classes in the ruling non-Oromo hierarchy, as opposed to the Oromos, whom he described as having a homogeneous warrior class.<ref>Bahrey, "History of the Galla" (1593). Translated by C.F. Beckingham and G.W.B. Huntingford in ''Some Records of Ethiopia 1593-1646'' (London: The , 1954). This is the earliest known account of the Oromo.</ref> Bahrey also explained their spread into northwestern areas such as , , , and  and northeastern areas like  and  as result of their inhospitable homeland.<ref>Marcus, Harold G.

Settled Oromo started to integrate with their Amharic-speaking neighbors at least from the 17th century on. Also, several Oromo chieftains obtained power in government of the monarchy. Particularly Emperor Iyoas I (1730-55), who was half Oromo, favored his mother's Oromo kinsmen and allies, and in his era, the Oromo language was the language of the court in Gondar.
By the late 18th century, the power of the central government of Ethiopia had waned, and local governors and kings enjoyed greater autonomy. During this era (which lasted until 1855), known as the , the Oromo dynasty of chiefs of  were the most important continuous line of warlords to dominate the figurehead emperors of Ethiopia. They became sub-kings of , s (Regents) of the empire, as well as imperial fathers-in-law. Ras  achieved this dominance in 1779, and it continued, although contested by other warlords, until the 1855 defeat of Ras  by the upstart  (who in that year became Emperor Tewodros II). Due to the powerlessness of the  during the Zemene Mesafint, the Yejju Oromo were effectively the rulers of Ethiopia.
Other tribes and chiefs of the Oromo people were also prominent, such as lady Menen of Wollo who became Empress in 1800s; Ras Mohammad of Wollo who became Ras , later Negus of Siyon and father of Emperor ; and another lady Menen, of , who became Empress consort of .
In order to integrate with the imperial power and family, a large share of the Oromo converted to Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity during these centuries. As one of the last such developments, in late 1800s Emperor  ordered the Oromo tribe of Wollo to convert to Christianity within six months at the threat of losing their property. Such a threat had caused many Wollo Oromos to leave their homeland and migrate further to the South. Their leader was Ras Mohammed who became Ras Mikael and later made an imperial marriage, becoming the father of Emperor Iyasu V.
The Oromo are divided into two major branches that break down into an assortment of clan families. From west to east, these subgroups are:
'''The Borana''' which include:
And countless subdivisions.
'''The Barento/Barentuma''' which include:
And countless subdivisions.
Oromo society was traditionally structured in accordance with '''', a  system partially based on an eight-year cycle of  sets, but over the centuries the age sets grew out-of-alignment with the actual ages of their members, and some time in the 1800s another age set system was instituted. Under gadaa, every eight years the Oromo would hold a  called the ''Gumi Gayo'', at which laws were established for the following eight years. A democratically elected leader, the ''Abba Gada'', presided over the system for an eight-year term. Gadaa is no longer in wide practice but remains influential.
In a short article, Geoffrey W. Arnott described an Oromo rite of passage in which young men run over the backs of bulls surrounded by the village community.<ref>Arnott, "Bull Leaping as Inititation Ritual," ''Liverpool Classical Monthly'' 18 (1993), pp. 114-116</ref> Bruce Parry filmed the same practice among the Hamar people for his BBC television series "Tribe" transmitted in July 2006. Arnott's interest lay in making a comparison with bull-leaping at Knossos in the Aegean Bronze Age.
Muslim is the most practiced faith among the Oromo. In the 1994 Ethiopian census in the 85% Oromo region of Oromia, 44.3% were Muslims, 41.3% Orthodox Christians, 8.6% Protestants, 4.2% Traditional, and the remaining 1.6% constitute other religious groups. Protestant Christianity is the fastest growing religion inside the Oromo community. In urban Oromia Orthodox Christians constitute 67.8% of the population, followed by Muslims 24.0% and Protestants 7%.<ref>[http://www.ethiopar.net/English/basinfo/infoormy.htm FDRE States: Basic Information - Oromia], Population (accessed 26 March 2006)</ref>
Historically, the Afaan Oromo speaking people used the indigenous Gadaa system of governance that is relatively said to be more democratic than other forms of governance in the region. Many Oromo communities - most notably Gibe Kingdoms, around  - gradually adopted monarchy and other forms of governance in the later centuries of 2nd . Such changes occurred to due the growing influence of Islam from the east and Orthodox Christianity from the north as well as power struggle between opposing Oromo communities. 
Both the peaceful and violent competition and integration between Oromos and others neighboring ethnicities of Amhara, Sidama, Somali and others shaped up politics inside the Oromo community historically. Northern Expansion of Oromos, particularly the Arsi, to ethnic Somali and Sidama territories; the Yejju and other Oromo communities to the north, mirrored the southern expansion of Amharas to influence the current ethnic politics in Ethiopia.<Ref>[http://hrw.org/reports/pdfs/e/ethiopia/ethiopia.919/c3wollo.pdf Oromo and Amhara rule in Ethiopia]</ref>
During the last two centuries, Oromos who have not integrated with the Amhara have not had fair political power inside Ethiopia. However, ethnically mixed Ethiopians with Oromo background made up a high percentage of Ethiopian generals and leaders. The Wollo Oromo (particularly the Raya Oromo and Yejju Oromo) were early Oromo holders of power among the increasingly mixed Ethiopian state. The later north-to-south movement of central power in Ethiopia led to Oromos in Shewa holding power in Ethiopia together with the Shewan . This led to more political and ethnic mixture between Amhara and Oromo in Shewa region, to the degree that northern Amharas labeled Shewan Amharas using the derogatory term "Galla." <ref>[http://hrw.org/reports/pdfs/e/ethiopia/ethiopia.919/c3wollo.pdf  northern Amhara regarded the Shewans as "Galla"]</ref> According to a report by , the large presence of assimilated Oromos inside the Ethiopian government did not benefit Oromos who did not assimilate.
Nonetheless, both ethnically mixed Oromos and those with full Oromo descent held high leadership positions in Ethiopia. Notably  was the designated but uncrowned Emperor of Ethiopia (1913 - 1916) while  was the de jure Emperor of  from 1930 to 1974. Both these Ethiopian Emperors are ethnically mixed, with Oromo parents and lineages. During the '''' or "Age of Princes" of Ethiopia, Emperors became figureheads, controlled by warlords like Ras  of , and by the Oromo , which later led to 17th century Oromo rule of Gondar, changing the language of the court from  to .<ref>Pankhurst, Richard, ''The Ethiopian Royal Chronicles'', (London:Oxford University Press, 1967), pp. 139â€“43.</ref><Ref>[http://gargaaraoromopc.org/OPC_Program.aspx 17th century Oromo rule of Gondar]</ref> By the 1880s, Sahle Selassie, king of Shewa (the later Emperor ) allied with 's Shewan Oromo militia to expand his kingdom to the South and East, expanding into areas that hadn't been held together since the invasion of .<ref>''Great Britain and Ethiopia 1897-1910: Competition for Empire'' Edward C.

Most Oromos do not have political unity today due to their historical roles in the Ethiopian state and the region, the spread out movement of different Oromo clans and the differing religions inside the Oromo nation. Accordingly, Oromos played major roles in all three main political movements in Ethiopia (centralist, federalist and secessionist) during the 19th and 20th century. In addition to holding high powers during the centralist government and the monarchy, the Raya Oromos in Tigray played a major role in the revolt inside the  regional state, known as "Weyane" revolt, challenging Emperor 's rule in the 1940s. <ref>[http://hrw.org/reports/pdfs/e/ethiopia/ethiopia.919/c3wollo.pdf Raya Oromos inside the Weyane revolt of Tigray]</ref> Simultaneously, both federalist and secessionist political forces developed inside the Oromo community.  
Presently, a number of ethnic based political organizations have been formed to promote the interests of the Oromo. The first was the , founded in January 1963, but was disbanded by the government after several increasingly tense confrontations in November, 1966.<ref>Bahru Zewde, ''A History of Modern Ethiopia: 1855-1991'', 2nd edition (Oxford: James Currey, 2001), pp. 261f.</ref>  Later groups include the  (OLF), Oromo Federalist Democratic Movement (OFDM), the  (ULFO), the  (IFLO), the Oromia Liberation Council (OLC), the  (ONC, recently changed to OPC) and others. Another group, the  (OPDO), is one of the four  that form the ruling  (EPRDF) coalition. However, these Oromo groups do not act in unity: the ONC, for example, was part of the  coalition that challenged the EPRDF in the .
A number of these groups seek to create an independent Oromo nation, some using armed force. Meanwhile the ruling OPDO and several opposition political parties in the Ethiopian parliament believe in the unity of the country which has 80 different ethnicities that have been intermarrying and living together for centuries. But most Oromo opposition parties in Ethiopia condemn the economic and political inequalities in the country. Progress has been very slow with the  just recently established in 2008 though Oromo owned started early in the 1990s and with the first private Afaan Oromo newspaper in Ethiopia, Jimma Times, also known as Jimma Yeroo, recently established. University departments in Ethiopia did not establish curriculum in  until few did in the late 1990s.
Various human rights organizations have publicized the government persecution of Oromos in Ethiopia for decades. In 2008, OFDM opposition party condemned the government's indirect role in the death of hundreds of Oromos in western Ethiopia. <ref>[http://www.jimmatimes.com/article.cfm?articleID=31292 OFDM Press Release: The Massacre of May, 2008]</ref>
The Oromo used to be called called ''Galla'' by  non-Oromo Ethiopians, and one may encounter this name in older texts, but Oromos have never used this to refer to themselves, and it is considered a  term. Historically, some people among the northern Amhara community used the label "Galla" derogatorily to label Oromos as well as to label Shewan or southern Amharas who were mostly mixed with Oromo.<ref>[http://hrw.org/reports/pdfs/e/ethiopia/ethiopia.919/c3wollo.pdf  northern Amhara regarded the Shewans as "Galla"]</ref>
However, when Charles Tutschek, writing in the mid 19th century, researched the Oromo, "his informants, according to their published letters, used ''Galla'' as a term of self-reference."<ref>Baxter, P.T.W.; Hultin, Jan; Triulzi, Alessandro. ''Being and Becoming Oromo: Historical and Anthropological Enquiries.''  (United States:Red Sea Press, Inc.: 1996), p.107.</ref>  The name has fallen into disfavor and is now considered to be , possibly because of a  for "Galla" (that it came from ''Qal la/ÙƒÙŽÙ„'', pronounced similar to ''Gal la'',  for "ney/no way") that implies they refused 's offer to convert to . In the , the word ''gaal'' means "non-" or "stranger", a possible reference to the Oromo and their old pagan religion.<ref>Paul Trevor William Baxter et al., ''Being and Becoming Oromo: Historical and Anthropological Enquiries'', (Nordic Africa Institute: 1996), p.109</ref>
