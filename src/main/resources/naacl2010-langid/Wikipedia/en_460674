'''Nifedipine''' (brand name '''Adalat''', '''Nifedical''', and '''Procardia''') is a  . Its main uses are as an  (especially in ) and , although a large number of other uses have recently been found for this agent, such as , , and painful spasms of the  in  and  patients. It is also commonly used for the small subset of  patients whose symptoms respond to .
Nifedipine rapidly lowers blood pressure, and patients are commonly warned they may feel dizzy or faint after taking the first few doses.  (fast heart rate) may occur as a reaction. These problems are much less frequent in the sustained-release preparations of nifedipine (such as Adalat OROS). A more novel release system is GITS (Gastro-Intestinal Therapeutic System), which - according to Bayer - provides 24-hour continuous release through an osmotic push system. Recent trials with GITS include INSIGHT (for blood pressure)<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brown MJ, Palmer CR, Castaigne A, ''et al'' |title=Morbidity and mortality in patients randomised to double-blind treatment with a long-acting calcium-channel blocker or diuretic in the International Nifedipine GITS study: Intervention as a Goal in Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT) |journal=Lancet |volume=356 |issue=9227 |pages=366–72 |year=2000 |pmid=10972368|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02527-7}}</ref> and ACTION (for angina).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Poole-Wilson PA, Kirwan BA, Vokó Z, de Brouwer S, van Dalen FJ, Lubsen J |title=Safety of nifedipine GITS in stable angina: the ACTION trial |journal=Cardiovas Drugs Ther|volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=45–54 |year=2006 |pmid=16552473 |doi=10.1007/s10557-006-6312-4}}</ref>
Extended release formulations of nifedipine should be taken on an empty stomach, and patients are warned not to consume anything containing  or grapefruit juice, as they raise blood nifedipine levels. There are several possible mechanisms, including the lowering of  activity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Odou P, Ferrari N, Barthélémy C, ''et al'' |title=Grapefruit juice-nifedipine interaction: possible involvement of several mechanisms |journal=Journal Clinical Pharm Ther |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=153–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15811168 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2710.2004.00618.x}}</ref>
It is also used to block pre-term contractions in pregnant women.
The approved uses for nifedipine are the long-term treatment of  (high blood pressure) and . In hypertension, recent clinical guidelines generally favour s and s, although calcium channel antagonists are still favoured as primary treatment for older black patients.<ref>''Hypertension: management of hypertension in adults in primary care''.

Nifedipine has been used frequently as a  (agent that delays premature labor). A Cochrane review has concluded that it is comparable with magnesium sulfate and beta-agonists (such as ) with fewer side-effects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=King JF, Flenady VJ, Papatsonis DN, Dekker GA, Carbonne B |title=Calcium channel blockers for inhibiting preterm labour |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD002255 |year=2003 |pmid=12535434|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002255}}</ref> Its role ''vis à vis''  is not established.

A 2005 meta-analysis showed modest benefits (33% decrease in attack severity, 2.8-5 reduction in absolute number of attacks per week); it does conclude that most included studies used low doses of nifedipine.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Thompson AE, Pope JE |title=Calcium channel blockers for primary Raynaud's phenomenon: a meta-analysis |journal=Rheumatology (Oxford, England) |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=145–50 |year=2005 |pmid=15546967 |doi=10.1093/rheumatology/keh390}}</ref>
