'''Western Park''' is a midsized public park located in the suburb of , west of the CBD of , New Zealand.
It is situated in two merging gullies which run downhill to the sea (now several kilometres away due to land reclamation) from what was once called Te Rimu Tahi ridge (the 'lone Rimu tree ridge' in Maori). Originally, the Tuna Mau stream used to run through the park's area.<ref name="ACC">[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/whatson/places/parks/westernpark.asp Western Park] (from the  website)</ref> The location makes the southern parts of the park rather step, so that it is accessed by boardwalk stairs descending from Hopetoun Street or steep paths from Ponsonby Road, while the main entry is from Beresford Street West or lower Howe Street. 
The park has several walkways, public toilets, a children's playground and a small performance space blended into the scenery.<ref>[http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/westernpark/default.asp Western Park performance space] (from the  website)</ref>
The park dates back to the mid-19th century, and is considered one of the city's most distinguished open spaces.<ref name="ACC"/> It may be considered Auckland's oldest park.<ref name="INFO"/> The original park consisted of only a coffin-shaped wedge going from  down to Beresford Street, with access to the park being gained from a very narrow frontage on Ponsonby Road. Before, a stream had flowed through the general area, called ''Tuna-Mau'' by the local , meaning 'the trapping of s'.<ref name="INFO"/>
In 1873, the Council decided to call for a new park design, and declared that the sum of ten guineas/pounds (then quite a sum) would be awarded as prize money to the creator of the winning design. Out of 11 different concepts were submitted, the 'Lily of the Valley' design of Hammond and Blackmore was chosen. The new park was soon finished, at a cost of 200 pounds<ref name="INFO">Auckland City information board at the park's lower end, present as of August 2007.</ref> and in 1874 the City Parks Committee did note that "upwards of 1100 deciduous and coniferous trees of the choicest kind <nowiki>[were]</nowiki> to be planted in the park." Vesting to the City Council followed in 1875 and in 1879 the '''' reported the city following the example of 'the civilised world' with the official opening on November 17.<ref name="ACC"/><ref name="INFO"/>
Recently various works have been undertaken, including tree planting, improvement works followed the original design as well as installation of artworks by sculptor  near the Ponsony entrance as well as park furniture by local artist and silversmith . The three sculpture works represent pieces of buildings that once stood in Auckland, artistically sunk into the ground in the manner of ancient ruins.<ref name="ACC"/>
