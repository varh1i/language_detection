The Danish Final was held in the Århus Kongrescentrum in Århus on February 7th 2004, hosted by Natasja Crone and Peter Mygind. After missing out on 2003, DR has announced preliminary details on their final for the Qualification Round. As predicted there will be NO semi finals. Instead, DR will use their formula of 1 final to choose their song. All songs had to be entered by Monday November 3rd 2003; a total of 315 songs were sent in. Once again, all songs had to be sung in Danish and translated into English for the Eurovision.
The winner was chosen in two rounds of voting - in the first round, the top 5 songs were selected by televoting. After they'd been performed again, the winner was chosen by 4 televoting regions and SMS voting.The winning song was performed in English as "Shame on you" at the ESC Semi-Final, where Tomas came 13th
