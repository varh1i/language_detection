'''Vertical farming''' is a conceptual form of  done in  s. In these high-rises (variously called "farmscrapers,"<ref>[http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2007/4/23/104245/760#comment5 Urbanism and the environment | Gristmill: The environmental news blog | Grist<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>) food such as fruit, vegetables, fish, and livestock can be raised by using greenhouse growing methods and d resources year-round, allowing cities of the future to become self-sufficient.
Recent research into the concept has been primarily the brainchild of Dickson Despommier, a  of  sciences and microbiology at  in , .

Since 2007, there have been numerous articles featuring the vertical farm in the popular press and in professional architectural journals, including US News and World Report, Popular Science and Maxim,  as well as radio and television features. 
The potential advantages of vertical farming are many. First, there would be no weather related crop failures. Second, continuous production of food (i.e., no seasons) would be the norm. Vertical farming could greatly reduce or even prevent further , , and other consequences of encroachment for agricultural land use if employed on large scale. By  within population centers, fossil fuel use would be greatly reduced (no plowing, planting, harvesting by farm machinery), and reduction of food miles means less  is generated transporting produce from the vertical farm to the market. The controlled environment of a multi-story greenhouse will obviate the need for s, s, and s. Employing a combination of hydroponic, aeroponic, and other related growing strategies will allow most crops to be produced in large quantities indoors. As currently envisioned, the vertical farm would also be designed to make use of energy generated from wind power, solar power, and incineration of raw sewage and the inedible portion of harvested crops. Instead of producing agricultural runoff (currently the world's most serious source of pollution), the vertical farm aspires to become truly self-sustaining. In that regard, the water of evapo-transpiration can also be harvested and re-used in crop production, or exported from the farm as a source of drinking water. Today, over 70% of the liquid fresh water on Earth is used for horizontal soil-based agriculture, and once used it is not usable for anything else due to the common use of agrochemicals and pesticides. Vertical farms will require significantly less water, and as mentioned, will have the option of re-cycling it.  
Professor Despommier argues that the technology to construct vertical farms currently exists.  He also believes that the system can be profitable and effective, a claim evidenced by some preliminary research posted on the project's website.
