Called ''Eskimåkvinnans skinnbyxa'' (the  woman's leather breech), the design was comprised of a series of crayon drawings on cardboard and scratch paper. Aalto created initial prototypes by blowing glass in the middle of a composition of wooden sticks stuck into the ground, letting the molten glass swell on only some sides and creating a wavy outline.

The ''Savoy Vase'' name is the result of the purchase of the vase, and rights to the design, by the Savoy Restaurant in . Aalto never made money with the vase, because the design belonged to the factory for which the design competition entry was produced.
The vase has been manufactured in nearly a full spectrum of colours. The simplicity of the vase continues to be popular in the 21st century. Smaller versions of the vase, just as Aalto designed them with the seams visible and a slight curve at the base, are still produced by glasspressing at the '''' glass factory in Iittala, Finland.  Larger versions are made using Aalto's design, but without seams.-->
