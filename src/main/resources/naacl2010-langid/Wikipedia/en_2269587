'''Comair Flight 3272''' was a  flight departing on , , from  for the . While on approach for landing, the aircraft, an , crashed nose-down 18 miles short of the airport. All aboard, twenty-six passengers and three crew members, died as a result of the accident.
The  determined that the probable cause was inadequate standards for  operations while in flight, specifically the failure of the  to establish adequate minimum s for icing conditions, leading to a loss of control when the airplane accumulated a thin, rough accretion of ice on its lifting surfaces. 
A contributing factor was the decision of the crew to operate in icing conditions while near the lower end of the  while the flaps were retracted. Comair had not previously established unambiguous minimum airspeed values for flap configurations and for flight in icing conditions.
