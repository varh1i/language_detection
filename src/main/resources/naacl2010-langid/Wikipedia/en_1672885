''Grandia Xtreme'' plays very similarly to the rest of the games in the ''Grandia'' series, which all resemble a traditional  with somewhat random battles that occur within dungeons or during scripted situations. Combat takes place on a three-dimensional battlefield where the characters move around, striking enemies as they get near them. Very similar in both style and execution to 's battle system, with the notable exception being that the Battle Gauge, formerly stylized as a horizontal line, is now a circle that the character icons move along clockwise. Each icon represents a character or enemy currently in battle, and they move along it at a rate which corresponds to their "speed" rating. Once an icon reaches the top of the circle, they are allowed to either attack, use items, defend, or flee the battle. 
The game is progress by going through various dungeons and completing a number of -based problems. Instead of saving the progress using the recurrent rainbow-colored save points, a few "Geo Gates" are to be located, which transport the player back to the city - the only place with a save point in the armory. Some gates are one-way, and can only be used to return to Locca, not leaving an opportunity to return. After using these gates, players have to redo the dungeon.
Unlike story-driven RPGs, Grandia Xtreme is a heavy-grind game, meaning there is far more focus on levelling up and acquiring new equipment and skills than similar titles like the  series. There are only 7 main dungeons and three random dungeons (one of which becomes unavailable after the final boss is defeated). For a first-time playthrough, it will usually be necessary to play through some areas multiple times in order to become strong enough to advance past certain difficult battles.
After the first set of dungeons, each related to one of the , the game's difficulty ramps up in all areas (known as the first boost). The second boost takes place after the first randomized dungeon (a thirty-floor tower which links to three other dungeons every 10 floors), and a final boost occurs at the end of the main game. These can be markedly frustrating for inexperienced players, as the abilities of all monsters will increase simultaneously&mdash;meaning if underleveled at the time of a boost, the player will find it exceedingly difficult to proceed forward in the story or even train at the now-deadly earlier areas. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}
The fictional world of ''Grandia Xtreme'' is populated by three : the militaristic and resourceful Humans; the teal-haired, pointy-eared Arcadians characterized by their magic; and the tribal, pointy-eared Hazmans with dark skin and brown or red hair.
