Clayton village is of historical significance for a number of reasons. Firstly, Clayton with Frickley All Saints Church is unusually situated about 1.5 miles from the main village in the middle of a field, with no obvious access. The reason for this unusual siting stems back to plague times, when the village was effectively burnt to the ground and resited on the top of the hill following a plague epidemic. The only proof that the village was ever anywhere else is the oddly sited church.  Being the only stone building of the time, it was left where it was, and survives to this day as a place of worship.  The church has some interesting 18th-19th century graves including that for someone "cruelly murdered on the highway between Clayton and Frickley". The church is a small ancient structure, with a tower, in the interior are some cylindrical columns, and between the nave and chancel is a handsome Norman arch.
