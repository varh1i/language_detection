The '''Malaysia-Thailand border''' consist of both a land boundary across the  and maritime boundaries in the  and the /.  lies to the south of the border while  lies to the north. The Golok River forms the easternmost 95km stretch of the land border.
The land border is based on the one agreed to in the 1909 treaty between Thailand, then known as Siam, and the British which started to exert its influence over the northern Malay states of Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis and Terengganu. The four states had earlier been under Siamese control. Four Malaysian states abutt the border. They are (from west to east) , ,  and Kelantan.  The four Thai provinces which abutt the border are (again from west to east) are , ,  and .
Malaysia and Thailand have a  and  boundary agreements for the  which was signed in 1979 and 1971 respectively. The 1979 agreement also included  as a signatory as it also determined the common maritime tripoint for the three countries. The 1979 agreement also established the territorial sea boundary in the  while a separate memorandum of understanding signed in 1979 established a short continental shelf boundary. The boundary  beyond that agreed is subject to dispute because of overlapping claims over the seabed. The overlapping claims led to the establishment of a joint development area in 1990 where both countries agreed to share mineral resources in a 7,250 square km wedge-shaped area.
From west to east, the 646.5km Malaysia-Thailand border begins at a point which lies just north of the  estuary as defined in the schedule of the  where the western most land boundary terminus was to be at "the most seaward point of the northern bank of the estuary of the Perlis River".
The treaty then states that the border moves northward from this point to the Sayun Range, an extension of the Si Thammarat Mountains of Thailand, for about 15 miles (24km) before heading eastward along the watershed of Thailand's Lam Yai River and Malaysia's Perlis River towards the ridge of the Kedah-Singgora mountains where it moves soutwards along the ridgeline till it reaches the watershed for the Perak and Pattani Rivers. 
The border then moves eastward across the northern part of Peninsula Malaysia's Main Range (Malay: ''Banjaran Titiwangsa'') along the watershed of Malaysia's Perak River and Pergau River (in ) and Thailand's Pattani and Sai Buri Rivers until it reaches Bukit Jeli. An 8km stretch of the border around Bukit Jeli is being disputed by both countries (see ).
From Bukit Jeli, the boundary follows the Golok River until the river mouth at Kuala Tabar, a distance of 95km. The border follows the deepest part or  of the river.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Malaysia-Thailand Boundary | journal = International Boundary Study | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = | date = 15 November 1965 | year = 1965 | url = http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/limitsinseas/ibs057.pdf | doi = | id = }}</ref>
Malaysia and Thailand share maritime borders in two segments - in the Straits of Malacca and in the Gulf of Thailand/South China Sea. 
At the western terminus of the land boundary, the 1909 Anglo-Siamese treaty determines the start of the maritime boundary as:

The 1909 Anglo-Siamese Treaty states that the maritime boundary between the two countries as follows:
Subsequently, the two governments have had several agreements over their common maritime boundary. The 1973 continental shelf boundary agreement between the two governments only covered the Straits of Malacca segment and did not cover the border in the Gulf of Thailand. However, on 24 October 1979, an agreement<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Treaty between the Kingdom of Thailand and Malaysia relating to the Delimitation of the Territorial Seas of the two Countries | date = 24 October 1979 | year = 1979 | url =http://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/THA-MYS1979TS.PDF | accessdate = 2008-06-28}}</ref> and a memorandum of understanding<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Memorandum of Understanding between the Kingdom of Thailand and Malaysia on the Delimitation of the Continental Shelf Boundary between the two Countries in the Gulf of Thailand | date = 24 October 1979 | year = 1979 | url = http://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/THA-MYS1979CS.PDF | accessdate = 2008-06-28}}</ref> were signed to determine the common maritime boundary of the two countries in the Gulf of Thailand. The first agreement established the territorial sea boundary from the mouth of the Golok River at 6º 14’.5 N, 102º 05’.6 E to 6º 27'.5 N, 102º 10'.0 E. The MOU established the continental shelf boundary from the northern end-point to 6° 50'.0 N 102° 21'.2 E with one turning point in between. 
The boundary beyond the northern end-point is subject to dispute (see Disputes section ). However, both countries, during the course of negotiations to determine the maritime border, had come to an agreement to put aside the border dispute and allow for the joint exploitation of natural resources of the disputed area. The two countries signed a '''Memorandum of Understanding for the Establishment of a Joint Authority for the Exploitation of the Resources of the Sea-Bed in a Defined Area of the Continental Shelf of the Two Countries in the Gulf of Thailand''' on 21 February 1979, followed by an '''Agreement on the Constitution and Other Matters Relating to the Establishment of the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Authority''' on 30 May 1990 establishing the joint development area (JDA). Both agreements do not settle disputed maritime border and sovereignty issue of the disputed area. Both countries continued with their overlapping continental shelf claims. 
To reassert the claim, in December 1979 just after the two countries signed the MOU on the joint development area, Malaysia published a map<ref>See [http://www.mfa.gov.sg/reclamation/img3.html map] reproduced by the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the country's response in the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea [http://www.mfa.gov.sg/reclamation/ResponseofSingapore.htm case concerning the reclamation of lands by Singapore in the Straits of Johor].</ref> denoting its territorial sea and continental shelf and continued to assert its sovereignty over the entire joint development area. Malaysia's continental shelf boundary on the map corresponds with the western and northern limit of the joint development area. The eastern and northern limits of the joint development area corresponds with Thailand's claim over the continental shelf.
On 16 February 1988, Thailand issued a Royal Proclamation to establish its  boundary with Malaysia, establishing the limits of its claims in the disputed area. The boundary follows the eastern boundary of the .<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Royal proclamation establishing the Exclusive Economic Zone of the Kingdom of Thailand adjacent to the Exclusive Economic Zone of Malaysia in the Gulf of Thailand | date = 16 February 1988 | year = 1988 | url = http://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/THA_1988_1_Proclamation.pdf | accessdate = 2008-07-2}}</ref> 
It is noteworthy that a small triangle inside the northern side of the agreed joint development area was also subjected to an overlapping claim by  and in 1999, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam agreed to apply the joint development principles for this area. See section .

The border between Thailand or  and the sultanates of the Malay Peninsular ( today) has varied throughout history according to the influence the kingdom over the sultanates. The southern part of Siam has always been populated by Malays and traditional Malay sultanates of  (of which  was part), ,  (which consist of the areas of Singgora, Yala, Ligor and Setul) and  came under Siamese suzerainty in the 19th century. The Malay states to immediately to the south, namely Perak and Pahang were independent sultanates until the British started asserting influence over them in the late 1800s. The frontier between the states were largely vague and not well defined.
In 1785, the British ontained the island of  from the Sultan of . The channel between the island and the mainland of Peninsula Malaysia became the border between British territory and Kedah, and therefore Siamese, territory.
On 6 May 1869, Great Britain and Siam signed an agreement known as the Bangkok Treaty of 1869 where Siam ceded a piece of territory on the mainland opposite Penang to Great Britain. The territory became known as Province Wellesley (known as  today). The treaty also defined the border between British and Siamese territory and this border remains the boundary line between Penang and Kedah today, although both are now constituent states of .
On 9 July 1909, Great Britain and Siam signed another agreement in Bangkok. Known as the , the agreement ceded the states of Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu to Great Britain while Pattani remained in Siamese hands. The treaty, in one of its four annexes, defined the border between British and Siamese territories. This border ultimately became today's border between Malaysia and Thailand.
Thailand regained control of the Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu during World War II when the Japanese handed them over to the kingdom, thus moving the Malay States-Siamese border southwards again. However, the states were returned to the British at the end of the war.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Malaysia-Thailand Boundary | journal = International Boundary Study | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 3-4 | date = 15 November 1965 | year = 1965 | url = http://www.law.fsu.edu/library/collection/limitsinseas/ibs057.pdf | doi = | id = }}</ref>
There are two stretches of the Malaysia-Thailand border which is subject to dispute. The first involves the land border in the Bukit Jeli (Jeli Hill) at the headwaters of thye Golok River and the second involves the continental shelf boundary in the Gulf of Thailand. Both disputes have not resulted in any aggression between the two countries.
The alignment of an 8.5km stretch of the land border in the area known as Bukit Jeli (Jeli Hill) near the headwaters of the Golok River is currently being disputed by both countries. The resulting disputed territory has an area of 42 hectares. Negotiations to resolve the dispute through the joint subcommittee on cooperation along the border is on-going. The dispute arose in the 1990s when demarcation work for the land border almost reached completion. Malaysia's former Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar was quoted as saying that the failure was because of the inability to reach a consensus over a formula to solve the dispute. He said problems arose because the geographical features as described in border protocol of the 1909 Anglo-Siamese Treaty had changed.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | title = Talks over border demarcation with Thais to continue | newspaper = New Straits Times | pages = 12 | year = 2003 | date = 11 March 2003 | url = }}</ref>
The dispute over the  boundary between Malaysia and Thailand arises from the different baselines for Thailand which the two countries adopt in calculating the equidistant line for boundary. Thailand's proclaimed baseline runs from the terminus at Kuala Tabar (the eastern terminus of the Malaysia-Thailand land border as defined by the 1909 Anglo-Siamese Treaty) northwards to Ko Losin islet and then northwestwards to Ko Kra. Malaysia however does not regard Ko Losin as as valid baseline point and calculates the equidistant line on a baseline running along the shore.<ref>{{cite paper

While both countries have agreed on 24 October 1979<ref>''Treaty between Thailand and Malaysia relating to the Delimitation of the Territorial Seas of the Two Countries'' (24 October 1979), Article 2 and ''Memorandum of Understanding between the Kingdom of Thailand and Malaysia on the Delimitation of the Continental Shelf Boundary between the two Countries in the Gulf of Thailand'' (24 October 1979) Article 1.</ref> on their maritime boundary for this area running 29 nautical miles out to sea, the boundary beyond the northeastern terminus of the territorial sea is subject to dispute. Malaysia's continental shelf boundary extends from the terminus at coordinate 07º 49' N, 103º 02' 30" E which corresponds to Point 43 in a 1979 map published by Malaysia denoting its territorial sea and continental shelf. Thailand claims its continental shelf boundary extends from the terminus to coordinate 07º 22'.0 N, 103º 42' 30" E. A small slice of the disputed area is also subjected to a claim by Vietnam.
As a temporary solution to the dispute, Malaysia and Thailand on 21 February 1979 signed a memorandum of understanding to create a 7,250km square joint development area encompassing the entire disputed area. This was later followed by an agreement on 30 May 1990. The agreement allows for joint exploitation and benefit of natural resources in the joint development area. In 1999, Malaysia, Thailand and  reached an agreement based on the principal of joint development for the area where the three countries have overlapping claims. All the agreements specifically state that they do not compromise each country's sovereignty claim over the disputed area. <ref>{{cite paper

The '''Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area''' is a 7,250km square area in the  which was created as a means to solve the maritime dispute between the two countries. The formula allows for both countries to share the non-living natural resources of the area on a 50:50 basis. It however does not extinguish the sovereignty claims by both countries over the area. This is one of the first applications of the joint development principle in territorial disputes in the world.

Malaysia's continental shelf limit claim is from Point A to Point C via Point B and thence to Point G while Thailand's Exclusive Economic Zone claim limit is from Point A to Point G through Points D, E, and F. It has not delimited its continental shelf limits beyond Point G.
In the 1970s, both Malaysia and Thailand constructed walls along their common border, mostly in / and / as well as / portions of the border to curb smuggling. The walls were of concrete, steel and topped barbed wire as well as iron fencing at other stretches. As both countries constructed their own walls a little into their own territory, a strip of "no-man's-land" about 10m wide was created and this strip of land became a convenient refuge for smugglers (not all smuggling was deterred by the wall) and drug runners. 
In 2001, the two countries agreed to construct just one wall along the border which would be located just inside Thai territory. The new border wall is 2.5m high and made up of a concrete lower half and steel fencing on the upper half. At the base, barbed wire running along the length of the wall.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | title = "No man's land" in M'sia-Thai border to be scrapped | newspaper = Utusan Malaysia Internet Edition | pages = | year = 2001 | date = 2001-08-03 | url = }}</ref>
While the stated reason for the construction of the wall has been to curb smuggling and encroachment, security reasons - earlier in the 1970s and 1980s resulting from Malaysian communist groups and groups involved in the  in the late 1990s and early 2000s - have also been a major push for the barrier to be constructed.
