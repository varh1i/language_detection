'''Indian Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology''' <ref>{{cite web | title=IIEST press release | url=http://www.pib.nic.in/archieve/others/2007/May07/2007050113.pdf}}</ref>(''IIEST'') are institutes proposed by the  to meet the growing demand for engineering and scientific manpower to meet our countryâ€™s increased industrialization. The proposed IIESTs would be created by an act of the Parliament of India. They would be given the status of Institutes of National Importance, on the lines of IITs and NITs by the Indian government. 
Initially, a group of seven elite universities had been selected for upgradation to the status of IITs by the S.K.Joshi committee. Since these colleges were controlled by the respective state governments and which couldn't be given IIT status due to political, administrative or technical reasons the MHRD appointed another Committee, called the Anandakrishnan Committee. The Committee recommended setting up a new family of institutes by upgrading the selected group of colleges and to be called IIESTs (Indian Institute of Engineering, Science and Technology). Later, the Government of India shortlisted it to five institutions for the upgradation.
As per the discussion with the Committee members, the IIESTs are supposed to receive funding similar to that of IITs after the planned upgrade over next five years. IIESTs can achieve more govt. support/funding by uniting together on a collective bargaining principle. Each college will receive one-time amount (spread over 5 years) of Rs. 500 crores (Rs. 5 billion or $ 125 million) for infrastructure improvement and annual funding of Rs. 50 crores.
BESU along with CUSAT would be the first two IIESTs to start functioning from the academic year 2008-09. BESU has already received the formal approval letter from the Govt. of India. <br />
The five institutions have been short-listed based on the final Anandakrishnan report are as follows:
