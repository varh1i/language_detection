The '''IUCN Red List of Threatened Species''' (also known as the '''IUCN Red List''' or '''Red Data List'''), created in 1963, is the world's most comprehensive inventory of the global  status of plant and animal . The  (IUCN) is the world's main authority on the conservation status of species.<ref name=Mrosovsky>Nature '''389''', 436 (2 October 1997) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v389/n6650/abs/389436a0.html]</ref>
The IUCN Red List is set upon precise criteria to evaluate the  risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world.  The aim is to convey the urgency of conservation issues to the public and policy makers, as well as help the international community to try to reduce species extinction.
Major species assessors include , the  (the research division of the ), the , and many Specialist Groups within the IUCN's  (SSC). Collectively, assessments by these organizations and groups account for nearly half the species on the Red List.
IUCN Red List is widely considered to be the most objective and authoritative system for classifying species in terms of the risk of extinction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/action/science/species/global_species_programme/red_list.html |title=Birds on the IUCN Red List |accessdate=2007-02-01 |work=BirdLife International }}</ref>
The IUCN aims to have the category of every species re-evaluated every 5 years if possible, or at least every ten years. This is done in a ed manner through IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Specialist Groups, which are Red List Authorities responsible for a species, group of species or specific geographic area, or in the case of , an entire class ().<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/programme |title=Establishment of Red List Authorities |accessdate=2006-11-12 |work=The IUCN SSC Red List Programme }}</ref>
The  Red List, released on ,  evaluated 40,168 species as a whole, plus an additional 2,160 , , aquatic , and s.
From the species evaluated as a whole, 16,118 were considered . Of these, 7,725 were s, 8,390 were s, and three were  and s.
This release listed 784 species extinctions recorded since  , unchanged from the  release. This was an increase of 18 from the 766 listed as of {{Fact|date=February 2008}}. Each year a small number of "extinct" species may be rediscovered, becoming , or may be reclassified as "data deficient". In , the extinction list dropped to 759 species, but has been rising ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/misc/wikipedia|title=Data figures for Wikipedia citations|accessdate=2008-02-28|work=IUCN Red List website}}</ref>
On , 2007, the  (IUCN) released the ''' IUCN Red List of Threatened Species''', the latest update to their  of '  risks.  In this release, they have raised their  of both the  (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla'') and the  (''Gorilla gorilla diehli'') from  to , which is the last  before , due to  and , along with other factors.  Russ Mittermeier, chief of  -based IUCN's Primate Specialist Group, stated that 16,306 species are endangered with extinction, 188 more than in 2006 (total of 41,415 species on the Red List).<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070912/ap_on_re_eu/endangered_gorillas  Yahoo.com, Gorillas now 'critically endangered']</ref>  The Red List includes the  (''Pongo abelii'') in the Critically Endangered category and the  (''Pongo pygmaeus'') in the Endangered category.<ref>[http://www.iucn.org/en/news/archive/2007/09/12_pr_redlist.htm  IUCN.org news release,  Extinction crisis escalates: Red List shows apes, corals, vultures, dolphins all in danger]</ref>
Species are classified in nine groups, set through criteria such as rate of decline, population size, area of geographic distribution, and degree of population and distribution fragmentation.
When discussing the IUCN Red List, the official term "" is a grouping of three categories: Critically Endangered, Endangered, and Vulnerable.
The older  has only a single "Lower Risk" category which contained three subcategories: 
In the 2001 system, Near Threatened and Least Concern have now become their own categories, while Conservation Dependent is no longer used and has been merged into Near Threatened.
The additional category of ''Possibly Extinct'' (PE)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/06/possibly_extinct_paper.pdf|title=Going or gone: defining 'Possibly Extinct' species to give a truer picture of recent extinctions|author=S.

Birdlife International has recommended PE become an official category. BirdLife International has not stated whether a "Possibly Extinct in the Wild" category should also be added, although it is mentioned that  has this status. "Possibly Extinct" can be considered a subcategory of "Critically Endangered".
The IUCN Red List has come under criticism on the grounds of  surrounding the sources of data, among other allegations.<ref>{{cite journal | author = N.
