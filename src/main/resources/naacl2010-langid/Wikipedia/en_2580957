The '''urachus''' is an embryological canal connecting the  of the fetus with the , a structure that contributes to the formation of the umbilical cord. The lumen (inside) of the urachus is normally obliterated during embryonic development, transforming the urachus into a solid cord, a functionless remnant. The urachus lies in the , between the transversalis fascia anteriorly and the  posteriorly.
The vesico-urethral portion of the  absorbs the ends of the  and the associated ends of the , and these give rise to the  and part of the . 
The remainder of the vesico-urethral portion forms the body of the bladder and part of the prostatic urethra; its apex is prolonged to the  as a narrow canal, which later is obliterated and becomes the  ('''urachus''').
Note:  The two '''s''' are the obliterated .
Failure for the lumen of the urachus to be filled in leaves a patent (open) urachus. The telltale sign is leakage of urine through the umbilicus. A patent urachus needs to be surgically removed.
