'''Psilocybin''' (IPA: /saɪləˈsaɪbɪn/)(also known as '''psilocybine''') is a   of the  family, found in .  It is present in hundreds of species of , including those of the genus '''', such as '''' and '''', but also reportedly isolated from a dozen or so other genera. s are commonly called "magic mushrooms" or more simply "shrooms".  Possession, and in some cases usage, of psilocybin or psilocin has been outlawed in many if not most countries across the globe.<ref>[http://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_law.shtml Erowid Psilocybin Mushroom Vault : Legal Status<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.  Proponents of its usage consider it to be an  and a  to supplement various types of practices for , including in , , and  {{Fact|date=February 2008}}.  The intensity and duration of entheogenic effects of  are highly variable, depending on species/cultivar of mushrooms, dosage, individual physiology, and .  Though psilocybin rarely attracts much attention from mainstream media, when it does the focus tends to be on the recreational use, generally excluding any other uses of the drug.
Psilocybin is a  that is converted into the  active compound  in the body by .<ref>Horita, A. and L.J. Weber. "Dephosphorylation of psilocybin to psilocin by ." Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology 106(1): 32-33 (1961)</ref> This  takes place under strongly  conditions or  by s in the body. Psilocybin is a ic alkaloid that is soluble in water, moderately soluble in  and , and insoluble in most s. 
, the well-known chemist who discovered and experimented with LSD, was the first to recognize the importance and chemical structure of the pure compounds psilocybin and psilocin. Hofmann was aided in this process by his willingness to ingest  isolated from ''Psilocybe''. Hofmann's colleagues at the  were also trying to isolate the active principle, but were unsuccessful.<ref>[http://www.stainblue.com/ah.html Dr. Albert Hofmann | Psilocybin | Psilocin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Psilocybin is a naturally-occurring compound found in varying concentrations in some species of the genera of '''' and '''' (fungal Phylum ). The spores of these mushrooms are completely free of both psilocybin and psilocin. The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens of one species in the same batch. Younger, smaller mushrooms are relatively higher in alkaloids and have a milder taste than larger, mature mushrooms.{{Fact|date=April 2008}} Mature  contains some psilocybin. Young mycelium (recently germinated from spores) does not contain appreciable amounts of alkaloids.  Many species of mushrooms containing psilocybin also contain small amounts of the psilocybin analogs  and . Some species of psilocybin mushrooms bruise blue when handled or damaged due to the oxidization of phenolic compounds. This is not a definitive method of identification or determining a mushroom's potency.
Psilocybin is rapidly dephosphorylated in the body to  which then acts as a  at the   in the brain where it mimics the effects of  (5-HT).  Psilocin is an 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> agonist.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}
Psilocybin has no recognized medical uses.  However, it has been investigated as an experimental treatment for several disorders. 
In 1961,  and  ran the , carrying out a number of experiments concerning the use of psilocybin in the treatment of personality disorders and other uses in psychological counselling.
A pilot study led by Francisco Moreno and supported by  (MAPS) studied the effects of psilocybin on nine patients with .<ref>http://www.maps.org/research/psilo/azproto.html Effects of psilocybin in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</ref>.

Two current studies are investigating the possibility that psilocybin can ease the psychological suffering associated with cancer.  One study, led by Charles Grob, involves 12 subjects with terminal cancer being administered the hallucinogen or a placebo in two separate sessions.<ref>[http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00465595 Psychopharmacology of Psilocybin in Cancer Patients - ClinicalTrials.gov<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>hhtp://http://psychedelics.com/psilocybe/psilocybin.html The Hallucinogenic Way of Dying</ref><ref>Lewis, Judith.

The  of psilocybin is relatively low; in s, the oral  is 280mg/kg, approximately one and a half times that of . When administered intravenously in s, psilocybin's LD<sub>50</sub> is approximately 12.5mg/kg<ref name="tox">[http://chem.sis.nlm.nih.gov/chemidplus/ProxyServlet?objectHandle=DBMaint&actionHandle=default&nextPage=jsp/chemidheavy/ResultScreen.jsp&ROW_NUM=0&TXTSUPERLISTID=000520525 NLM] (click on "toxicity" on the left side)</ref><!--also: Merck Index 12th Edition--> (However rabbits are extremely intolerant to the effects of most psychoactive drugs). The lethal dose from psilocybin intake alone is unknown at recreational or medicinal levels, and has never been documented; psilocybin makes up roughly 1% of the weight of Psilocybe mushrooms, and so nearly 1.7 kilograms of dried mushrooms, or 17 kilograms of fresh mushrooms, would be required for a 60kg person to reach the 280mg/kg LD50 rate of rats.
Psilocybin is absorbed through the lining of the mouth and stomach. Effects begin 10–40 minutes after ingestion of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, and last from 2–6 hours depending on dose, species, and individual metabolism.<ref>[http://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_dose.html Erowid Psilocybin Mushroom Vault : Dosage<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  A typical recreational dosage is from 10–50 mg psilocybin.
The effects of psilocybin are highly variable, and dependent on the current mood and overall sense of well-being by the individual.  Initially the subject may begin to feel somewhat disorientated, lethargic, and euphoric or sometimes depressed.  At low doses, hallucinatory effects may occur, including enhancement of colors and the animation of geometric shapes.   may occur, where the affected individual may see multi-coloured geometric shapes and vivid imaginative sequences.  At higher doses, hallucinatory effects increase and experiences tend to be less social and more introspectic or ic.  Open-eye visuals are more common, and may be very detailed although rarely confused with reality.
Users having a pleasant experience may feel ecstatic, including a deep sense of connection to others, confusion, hilarity, and a general feeling of connection to nature and the universe. Difficult experiences or ''s'' may occur in some individuals, often when consumed during emotional turmoil, in a non-supportive or inadequate environment, by an inexperienced person, or in an unexpectedly high dose (see: '''').  Latent psychological issues may be triggered by the strong emotional components of the experience.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}
Some of these individuals report that they have experienced a 'spiritual' episode. For example, in the , which was run by a graduate student at  under the supervision of Timothy Leary, almost all of the graduate degree divinity student volunteers who received psilocybin reported profound religious experiences. A brief video about the Marsh Chapel experiment can be viewed [http://www.yoism.org/?q=node/52 here].
In 2006, a group of researchers from  led by Roland R Griffiths conducted an experiment assessing the degree of mystical experience and attitudinal effects of the psilocybin experience; this report was published in the journal ''Psychopharmacology''. Thirty-six volunteers without prior experience with hallucinogens were given psilocybin and  (Ritalin) in separate sessions, the methylphenidate sessions serving as a control and ; the tests were . The degree of mystical experience was measured using a questionnaire on mystical experience developed by [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Hood.htm Ralph W Hood]; 61% of subjects reported a "complete mystical experience" after their psilocybin session, while only 13% reported such an outcome after their experience with methylphenidate. Two months after taking psilocybin, 79% of the participants reported moderately to greatly increased life satisfaction and sense of well-being. About 36% of participants also had a strong to extreme “experience of fear” or  (i.e., a “”) at some point during the psilocybin session (which was not reported by any subject during the methylphenidate session), with about one-third of these (13% of the total) reporting that this dysphoria dominated the entire session. These negative effects were reported to be easily managed by the researchers and did not have a lasting negative effect on the subject’s sense of well-being.<ref name="urlMedical News: Psilocybin Viewed as Therapy or Research Tool - in Psychiatry, Addictions from MedPage Today">{{cite web |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Psychiatry/GeneralPsychiatry/tb/3721 |title=Medical News: Psilocybin Viewed as Therapy or Research Tool - in Psychiatry, Addictions from MedPage Today |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Further measures at 14 months after the psilocybin experience confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience.

A very small number of people are unusually sensitive to psilocybin's effects, where a normally threshold dose of around 2 mg of psilocybin can result in effects usually associated with medium and high doses. Likewise, there are some people who require relatively high doses of psilocybin to gain low-dose effects. Individual brain chemistry and metabolism plays a large role in determining a person's response to psilocybin.
Psilocybin is metabolized mostly in the  where it becomes psilocin. It is broken down by the enzyme .  have been known to sustain the effects of psilocybin for longer periods of time; people who are taking an MAOI for a medical condition or are seeking to potentiate the mushroom experience may experience highly potentiated effects.
Mental and physical tolerance to psilocybin builds and dissipates quickly. Taking psilocybin more than three or four times in a week (especially on consecutive days) can result in diminished effects. Tolerance dissipates after a few days, so frequent users often keep doses spaced five to seven days apart to avoid the effect.
In rare cases, psilocybin use can cause . {{fact|date=July 2008}}
Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as  drugs under the United Nations 1971 .<ref name="List of psychotropic substances under international control (International Narcotics Control Board)">{{cite web |url=http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/green.pdf |title=List of psychotropic substances under international control (International Narcotics Control Board) |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref> Schedule I drugs are illicit drugs that are claimed to have no known therapeutic benefit. Parties to the treaty are required to restrict use of the drug to medical and scientific research under strictly controlled conditions. Most national  have been amended to reflect this convention (for example, the US , the UK , and the Canadian ), with possession and use of psilocybin and psilocin being prohibited under almost all circumstances, and often carrying severe legal penalties.
Possession and use of psilocybin mushrooms, including the bluing species of ''Psilocybe'', is therefore prohibited by extension. However, in many national, state, and provincial drug laws, there is a great deal of ambiguity about the legal status of psilocybin mushrooms and the spores of these mushrooms, as well as a strong element of  in some places. For more details on the legal status of psilocybin mushrooms and ''Psilocybe'' spores, see: .
Because of the ease of cultivating psilocybin mushrooms or gathering wild species, purified psilocybin is often extremely difficult to find on the market.
