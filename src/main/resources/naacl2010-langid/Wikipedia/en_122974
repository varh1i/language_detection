A '''hybrid vehicle''' is a vehicle that uses two or more distinct power sources to propel the vehicle.<ref>[http://what-is-what.com/what_is/hybrid_vehicle.html What is a Hybrid Vehicle? - An introduction to hybrid cars and how they are defined, with examples of different hybrid technologies<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Common power sources include:
The term most commonly refers to  (HEV) which includes s and s.
There were large Chinese s depicted with sails and masts.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 276">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 276.</ref> Likewise, there are the same Chinese wheelbarrows with sailing masts depicted in the ''Atlas'' of  (– AD), as well as the 1626 AD book ''Kingdome of China''y J. Speed.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 276"/> The English poet  (– AD) popularized the Chinese sailing carriage in Europe with a poem written in 1665.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 276"/>
s and  are a simple form of a hybrid, as power is delivered both via an  or  and the rider's muscles. Early prototypes of motorcycles in the late 1800s used the same principles.
Hybrid s are used for  or  railway locomotives, buses, heavy goods vehicles, mobile , and ships. Ships with both sails and engines are an early form of hybrid which may return to more common use as costs of fuels rises. Typically some form of heat engine (usually diesel) drives an electric generator or hydraulic pump which power one or more electric or hydraulic motors. There are advantages in distributing power through wires or pipes rather than mechanical elements especially when multiple drives—e.g. driven wheels or propellers—are required. There is power lost in the double conversion from typically diesel fuel to electricity to power an electric or hydraulic motor. With large vehicles the advantages often outweigh the disadvantages especially as the conversion losses typically decrease with size. Presently there is no or relatively little energy storage capacity on most heavy vehicles, e.g. auxiliary batteries and s—this is changing.
An example of a typical "hybrid" is the new Canadian, -built railroad engine called the AGC (, high-capacity railcar) which has dual mode (diesel and electric motors) and dual voltage capabilities (1500 and 25000 V) allowing it to be used on many different rail systems. [http://www.enn.com/sci-tech/article/24048]. The first operational prototype of a hybrid train engine with significant energy storage and energy regeneration capability has been introduced in Japan as the Kiha E200. It utilizes battery packs of lithium ion batteries mounted on the roof to store recovered energy.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Japan-to-launch-first-hybrid-trains/2007/07/29/1185647720628.html | title = Japan to launch first hybrid trains | date = 2007-07-29 | publisher = The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref> In the U.S.,  introduced a prototype railroad engine with their "Ecomagination" technology in 2007. They store energy in a large set of sodium nickel chloride (Na-NiCl2) batteries to capture and store energy normally dissipated during dynamic braking or coasting downhill. They expect at least a 10% reduction in fuel use with this system and are now spending about $2 billion/yr on hybrid research.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ecotality.com/life/2007/10/25/around-the-world-on-brakes-chug-a-chug-a-chugga/ | last = Shabna | first = John | title = GE’s Hybrid Locomotive: Around The World on Brakes | publisher = Ecotality Life | date = 2007-10-25}}</ref>
Variants of typical diesel-electrical locomotives are like the  (GG) and  (GK) switching/yard engines built by Canada's . They utilize a large set of heavy duty long life (~10 yr) rechargeable lead acid (Pba) batteries and 1000 to 2000 HP electric motors as the primary motive sources and a new clean burning diesel generator (~160 Hp) for recharging the batteries that is used only as needed. No power or fuel are wasted for idling—typically 60–85% of the time for these type locomotives. Its unclear if  (regenerative) power is recaptured for reuse; but in principle should be easily utilized. Since these engines typical need extra weight for traction purposes anyway the battery pack's weight is a negligible penalty. In addition the diesel generator and battery package are normally built on an existing "retired"  "yard" locomotive's frame for significant additional cost savings. The existing motors and running gear are all rebuilt and reused. Diesel fuel savings of 40–60% and up to 80% pollution reductions are claimed over that of a "typical" older switching/yard engine. The same advantages that existing hybrid cars have for use with frequent starts and stops and idle periods apply to typical switching yard use.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.railpower.com/dl/GGSeries.pdf | title = GG Series: Hybrid Yard Switcher | author = RailPower Technologies Corp. | date = 2006-07-12}}</ref> "Green Goats" locomotives have been purchased by , ,  and  among others.
Railpower Technologies Corp. engineers working with TSI Terminal Systems Inc. in Vancouver, British Columbia are testing a hybrid diesel electric power unit with battery storage for use in  (RTG) cranes. RTG cranes are typically used for loading and unloading shipping containers onto trains or trucks in ports and container storage yards. The energy used to lift the containers can be partially regained when they are lowered. Diesel fuel and emission reductions of 50–70% are predicted by Railpower engineers.<ref>{{cite press release | date =  2006-10-10 | title = RailPower To SupplyY TSI Terminal Systems Inc. with hybrid power plants for rubber tyred gantry cranes | url = http://www.railpower.com/dl/news/news_2006_10_10_e.pdf}}</ref> First systems are expected to be operational in 2007.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/October2006/10/c6264.html | title = Railpower to supply TSI Terminal Systems Inc. with hybrid power plants for rubber tyred gantry cranes | date = 2006-10-10 | publisher = RailPower Technologies Corp.}}</ref>
 (''pictured'') and  SUVs' for 2008]]
Early hybrid systems are being investigated for trucks and other heavy highway vehicles with some operational trucks and buses starting to come into use. The main obstacles seem to be smaller fleet sizes and the extra costs of a hybrid system are yet compensated for by fuel savings, but with the price of oil set to continue on its upward trend, the tipping point may be reached by the end of 2008. Advances in technology and lowered battery cost and higher capacity etc. developed in the hybrid car industry are already filtering into truck use as Toyota, Ford, GM and others introduce hybrid pickups and SUVs. Kenworth Truck Company recently introduced a hybrid-electric truck, called the Kenworth T270 Class 6 that for city usage seems to be competitive.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/03/hybrid_truck_un.php | title = Hybrid Truck Unveiled by Kenworth | first = Justin | last = Thomas | date = 2007-03-27 | publisher = TreeHugger}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release | title = Kenworth Unveils T270 Class 6 Hybrid Truck Targeted at Municipal, Utility Applications  | url = http://www.kenworth.com/6100_pre_mor.asp?file=2105 | date = 2007-03-21 | publisher = Kenworth Truck Company}}</ref>  and others are starting to invest in hybrid delivery type vehicles—particularly for city use where hybrid technology may pay off first.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://features.us.reuters.com/autos/news/3AC0E602-90D5-11DC-9B79-FCFBBF5A.html | title = Hard sell for hybrid trucks | first = Christiaan | last = Hetzner | date = 2007-11-12 | publisher = Reuters}}</ref> The U.S. military is investigating hybrid <ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2006-02-13-humvee_x.htm | first = Steven | last = Komarow | date = 2006-02-13 | publisher = USA TODAY | title = Military hybrid vehicles could boost safety, mobility}}</ref> and other vehicles.

When the term ''hybrid vehicle'' is used, it most often refers to a . These encompass such vehicles as the  (, , , , and the ), , , , , ,  and others. A petroleum-electric hybrid most commonly uses  engines (generally gasoline or s, powered by a variety of fuels) and  to power s. There are many , from '''Full hybrid''' to , which offer varying advantages and disadvantages.<ref>[http://automobiles.honda.com/tools/calculators/mileage_calculator.asp?ModelNa,e=Civic+Hybrid# Fuel Saving Calculator]</ref>
While liquid fuel/electric hybrids date back to the late 1800s, the braking regenerative hybrid was invented by David Arthurs, an electrical engineer from Springdale, Arkansas in 1978-79. His home-converted Opel GT was reported to get as much as 75MPG and plans are still sold to this original design, and the "Mother Earth News" modified version on their website. <ref>[http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Transportation/1979-07-01/An-Amazing-75-MPG-Hybrid-Electic-Car.aspx AN AMAZING 75 - MPG HYBRID ELECTRIC CAR<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Given suitable infrastructure, permissions and vehicles, s can be recharged while the user drives. The BEV establishes contact with an electrified rail, plate or overhead wires on the highway via an attached conducting wheel or other similar mechanism  (see ). The BEV's batteries are recharged by this process—on the highway—and can then be used normally on other roads until the battery is discharged.
This provides the advantage, in principle, of virtually unrestricted highway range as long as you stay where you have BEV infrastructure access. Since many destinations are within 100 km of a major highway, this may reduce the need for expensive battery systems. Unfortunately private use of the existing electrical system is nearly universally prohibited.
The technology for such electrical infrastructure is old and, unfortunately outside of some cities, is not widely distributed (see , , , , ). Updating the required electrical and infrastructure costs can be funded, in principle, by toll revenue, gasoline or other taxes.
In addition to vehicles that use two or more different devices for , some also consider vehicles that use distinct energy sources or input types ("s") using the same engine to be hybrids, although to avoid confusion with hybrids as described above and to use correctly the terms, these are perhaps more correctly described as  vehicles:
 and s use an engine to charge a pressure accumulator to drive the wheels via  or  (i.e. ) drive units. The energy recovery rate is higher and therefore the system is more efficient than battery charged hybrids, demonstrating a 60% to 70% increase in  in EPA testing <ref>http://www.epa.gov/otaq/technology/420f05006.htm</ref>. Under tests done by the EPA, a hydraulic hybrid  returned {{mpg|32}} City, and {{mpg|22}} highway. <ref>http://www.autobloggreen.com/2006/06/15/capturing-the-power-of-hydraulics</ref> 
 currently has two trucks in service with this technology. <ref>http://www.autoblog.com/2006/06/26/epa-unveils-hydraulic-hybrid-ups-delivery-truck/</ref>
While the system has faster and more efficient charge/discharge cycling and is cheaper than gaselectric hybrids, the accumulator size dictates total energy storage capacity and requires more space than a battery.
The latest hybrid technology is the Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV). The PHEV consists of a gasoline-electric hybrid whose battery pack (usually Li-ion) is upgraded to a larger capacity, which can be recharged by either a battery charger hooked into the electrical grid or the gasoline engine (only if required). The car runs on battery power for the first 10 to 60 miles (16–100 km), with the gasoline engine available for faster acceleration, etc. After the battery is nearly discharged, the car reverts to the gasoline engine to recharge the battery and/or return the car to the charging station. This may get around the fundamental obstacle of battery range that has made nearly all pure electric cars impractical. Fuel costs (ignoring conversion costs), in principle, may be as low as 5 cents/mile. It's not clear yet whether converting an existing hybrid car will ever pay for itself in fuel savings. The biggest problem is finding a good, cheap, high-energy battery pack—the same problem that has plagued the pure electric car. If everyone plugged into the utility grid to charge up their car this would seem to be merely displacing the gasoline/diesel combustion problem to the typical coal powered electrical generating plant. But, if cars were recharged late at night this would allow the base load of the electrical system to be more efficient with a much more even base load and electrical power can also be generated by clean wind, hydro, tide power, etc.  Since most travel is about 30 miles/day this may be the cleanest personal transportation system presently available. There is a "cottage" conversion industry for owners of existing hybrids, and several large auto industry groups (GM, Toyota, Mercedes etc.) as well as the US Department of Energy<ref>{{cite paper | url = http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/pdfs/program/plug-in_summary_rpt.pdf | title = Summary Report: Discussion Meeting on Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles | publsiherr = U.S. Department of Energy | location = Washington, DC, USA | date = 2006-05-04 | author = Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy}}</ref>  are investigating this system. No major car company (as of late 2007) offers PHEVs yet. The typical "cottage" industry conversion car is the Toyota Prius (cost of conversion $5k-$40k), since it is a full hybrid with enough power in its electrical system to maintain typical city speeds.<ref>{{cite web | title = All About Plug-In Hybrids (PHEVs) | url = http://www.calcars.org/vehicles.html | author = California Cars Initiative | publisher =  International Humanities Center}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eaa-phev.org/wiki/Prius_PHEV#Kits_and_Conversions | title = Prius PHEV | publisher = Electric Auto Association - Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicle}}</ref>
The first type can propel itself using only the electric motor at very low speeds. The electric motor also has the ability to kick in and help out the gasoline engine when more power is needed, such as when passing or climbing a steep grade. The Toyota Prius and the Ford Escape Hybrid fall into this category. 
When a car like the Toyota Prius accelerates from a standstill, the electric motor gets the vehicle rolling and continues to drive it up to around 25 mph before the gasoline engine automatically starts up. Under hard acceleration from a stop, the gas engine starts immediately to provide maximum power. The electric motor and the gas engine also work in tandem when driving conditions demand more power, such as while climbing a hill or passing other vehicles. Because the electric motor is used so much at low speeds, the Prius and Escape get better mileage in the city than they do on the highway. 
The second type uses the electric motor only to assist the gasoline engine when it needs extra boost, again during brisk acceleration or when going up a hill. The Civic Hybrid and Honda Insight fall into the second category. 
When a car like the Honda Insight and Civic Hybrid, the electric motor assists the gas engine only when driving conditions demand more power, such as during hard acceleration from a stop, while climbing a hill or passing other vehicles. As with normal, gas-powered cars, these hybrids get better fuel economy while cruising on the highway, as that is when the gas engine is least taxed.
The hybrid vehicle typically achieves greater fuel economy and lower emissions than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), resulting in fewer emissions being generated. These savings are primarily achieved by four elements of a typical hybrid design: 
These features make a hybrid vehicle particularly efficient for city traffic where there are frequent stops, coasting and idling periods. In addition  are reduced, particularly at idling and low operating speeds,<ref>[http://luminatechnologies.org/luminaaco.html C. Michael Hogan and Amy Gregory, ''Hybrid Vehicle Emission Noise Comparison Study'', Lumina Technologies, June 1, 2006]</ref> in comparison to conventional gasoline or diesel powered engine vehicles. For continuous high speed highway use these features are much less useful in reducing emissions.
Hybrid Vehicle emissions today are getting close to or even lower than the recommended level set by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). The recommended levels they suggest for a typical passenger vehicle should be equated to 5.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide. The three most popular hybrid vehicles, ,  and , set the standards even higher by producing 4.1, 3.5, and 3.5 tons showing a major improvement in carbon monoxide emissions.
Though hybrid cars take in substantially less petroleum than conventional cars, there is still an issue regarding the environmental damage of the Hybrid car battery.  Today most Hybrid car batteries are one of two types: (1) nickel metal hydride, or (2) lithium ion; both are regarded as more environmentally friendly than lead-based batteries (which constitute the bulk of car batteries today).
“Jim Kliesch, author of the ‘Green Book: The Environmental Guide to Cars and Trucks’ told HybridCars.com, ‘There are many types of batteries. Some are far more toxic than others. While batteries like lead acid or nickel cadmium are incredibly bad for the environment, the toxicity levels and environmental impact of nickel metal hydride batteries—the type currently used in hybrids—are much lower.’"[http://www.hybridcars.com/battery-toxicity.html].
Though substantially less toxic than conventional car batteries, nickel-based batteries are known carcinogens, as well as can lead to a wide array of other health problems (little testing has been done to show the effects of nickel on people but other possible side effects may include: “, ed , short and twisted neck, short and twisted limbs, , , and reduced body size” [http://www.springerlink.com/content/x37h8256j6g27g84/]).
Although companies are funding research to use these safer less toxic batteries, the fact of the matter is lead is so cheap, and money always plays a factor when dealing with mass production of an item.{{what}} According to a 2003 report entitled, "Getting the Lead Out," by Environmental Defense and the Ecology Center of Ann Arbor, Mich., an estimated 2.6 million metric tons of lead can be found in the batteries of vehicles on the road today. There's little argument that lead is extremely toxic. Scientific studies show that long-term exposure to even tiny amounts of lead can cause brain and kidney damage, hearing impairment, and learning problems in children. The auto industry uses over one million metric tons of lead every year, with 90% going to conventional lead-acid vehicle batteries. While lead recycling is a mature industry, it's impossible to rescue every car battery from the dump. More than 40,000 metric tons of lead are lost to landfills every year. According to the federal Toxic Release Inventory, another 70,000 metric tons are released in the lead mining and manufacturing process.
