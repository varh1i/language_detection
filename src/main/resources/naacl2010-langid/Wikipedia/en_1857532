Virtually any question is allowed, except ones that violate the Yahoo! Answers [http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_guidelines.php community guidelines]. To encourage good answers, helpful participants are occasionally featured on the  blog page.  Though the service itself is free, the content of answers are owned by the respective users&mdash;while Yahoo! maintains a non-exclusive royalty-free worldwide right to publish the information.<ref>[http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Akv2Dl_I86xJes8iU685E5Dsy6IX?qid=20061205194905AA4o4tE What is the copyright status of responses submitted to Yahoo!

Answers.</ref> Chat is explicitly forbidden in the Community Guidelines, although users may choose to reveal their  ID on their Answers profile page.
In order to open an account a user needs a Yahoo! ID, but can use any name as identification on Yahoo! Answers. A user can also be represented by a  or a  picture. When answering a question, a pull-down menu allows one to choose to search all over the .
Questions are initially open to answers for four days. However the asker can choose to close the question after a minimum of four hours or extend it for a period of up to eight days.<ref>[http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers/ask/ask-55800.html Yahoo! Answers Help]</ref> To ask a question one has to have a Yahoo!  with a positive score balance.
The points system is weighted to encourage users to answer questions and to limit  questions. There are also levels (with point thresholds) which give more site access.<ref>[http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system Yahoo! Answers - Point System<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Aside from this, points and levels have no  value, cannot be traded, and serve only to indicate how active a user has been on the site. A notable downside to the points/level side is that it encourages people to answer questions even when they do not have a suitable answer to give, in order to gain points. On the other hand, many people ask questions that do not gain them more knowledge.
The point system encourages users to answer as many questions as they possibly can, up to their daily limit. Once a user gets to level 3 or 4, if they are able to maintain a good 'best answer' percentage (above 10%) within a specific category they will receive an orange 'badge' under the name of their avatar naming them a "Top Contributor." A user can be a "Top Contributor" in up to three categories, listed on the user's profile page, which can change depending on the user's answering habits. However, once a user becomes a "Top Contributor" in any category, the badge appears in all answers, questions, and comments by the user regardless of category.
<u>Level / points table</u>
 
Points are earned as per following Points Table: 
! Action
! Points
Voting and rating with "thumbs-up" or "thumbs-down" is done anonymously, and once done cannot be changed. Users may tag an interesting question with a star, and the list of users who have so tagged a question is made public.<ref>[http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoRKeB12yOcnUQp.9VCFos?p=16906 Yahoo! 360° - Yahoo! Answers Team Blog (answers.yahoo.com) - Seeing Stars?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On Answers profile pages, users can track how many stars they have received for their questions. However, a user may un-star a question at will. In the event a question is deleted, any stars it had at the time of deletion are still credited to the askers account.  Users may also keep a separate watchlist of questions that is kept private.
From time to time, the Yahoo! Answers team selects a user from the millions who use the feature and writes a  about him/her in the Yahoo! Answers Blog. This is called the Featured User section. The blog usually talks about the user's activity on the website, as well as a little bit about the user's hobbies. When a user is selected as a Featured User, he/she is sent an e-mail, asking for some details like hobbies, interests, occupation, etc. The user is usually expected to give a few comments on Yahoo! Answers as well. The user is expected to reply to the message appropriately, and the blog is put up in a few weeks. The Blog is on the  service.
Yahoo! Answers also has a "[http://answers.yahoo.com/best Best of Answers]" section, in which Yahoo! staff pick questions that have been answered with a particularly highly rated "best answer."
