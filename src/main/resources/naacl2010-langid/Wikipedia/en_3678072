The result was '''delete'''. No policy-based argument for keeping has been submitted. I would have speedied this as blatant spam ().  06:00, 7 December 2006 (UTC) 
This was originally prodded by  with the comment "Spam, even with extensive re-writes this article is simply a long ad for a bunch of softwear".  The prod was removed without comment by  (), an apparent single purpose account.  In 220.227.55.18's defense, he left a comment on SkierRMH's talk page (since blanked) asking how/if the article could be saved.  SkierRMH re-added the prod tag, which is not the right thing to do, so I've taken the article to AfD instead.  It does smell somewhat spammy, and I ''think'' it's a not-yet-launched portal, which would fall short of our notability guidelines, but I'm not entirely sure, and I'm a little concerned about the prodder's peremptory behavior (and his spelling), so I'm not sure of my own position on this yet.  Therefore, this nomination should be considered procedural (although I reserve the right to choose a side later after further study).  <sub></sub> 21:52, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
