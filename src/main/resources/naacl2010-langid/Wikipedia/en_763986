Mustafaa has been an on Wikipedia since early April, and has so far made 7476 contributions. He has earned quite an amazing reputation as a user who can work in the most controversial articles (, , etc.), and can keep his head and work towards consensus productively. Even those who adamantly disagree with his views praise him for his neutrality. We need more sysops like this. (He also works extensively in relatively non-controversial articles on linguistics and history.) A devoted and level-headed guy.  &ndash;  <sup>() ()</sup> 01:34, Nov 26, 2004 (UTC)
