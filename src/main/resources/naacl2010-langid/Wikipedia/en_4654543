'''Group I catalytic ''' are large self-splicing . They catalyze their own excision from ,  and  precursors in a wide range of organisms.  The core  consists of nine paired regions (P1-P9).  These fold to essentially two  - the P4-P6 domain (formed from the stacking of P5, P4, P6 and P6a helices) and the P3-P9 domain (formed from the P8, P3, P7 and P9 helices). The secondary structure mark-up for this family represents only this conserved core. Group I catalytic  often have long  inserted in .
 of '''group I introns''' is processed by two sequential  reactions. The   or guanosine  (''exoG'') first docks onto the active G-binding site located in P7, and its 3'-OH is aligned to attack the  at the 5' splice site located in P1, resulting in a free 3'-OH group at the upstream  and the exoG being attached to the 5' end of the intron. Then the terminal G (omega G) of the intron swaps the exoG and occupy the G-binding site to organize the second ester-transfer reaction, the 3'-OH group of the upstream exon in P1 is aligned to attacks the 3' splice site in P10, leading to the  of the adjacent upstream and downstream exons and free of the catalytic intron.

Since early 1990s, the community started to study how group I intron achieves its native structure in vitro, and some mechanisms of RNA  has been appreciated thus far. It is agreed that the tertiary structure is folded after the formation of the secondary structure. During , RNA molecules are rapidly populated into different folding intermediates, the intermediates containing native interactions are further folded into the native structure through a fast folding pathway, while those containing non-native interactions are trapped metastable or stable non-native conformations, and the process of conversion to the native structure occurs very slowly. It is evident that group I introns differing in the set of peripheral element display different potentials in entering the fast folding pathway. Meanwhile, cooperative assembly of the tertiary structure is important for folding of the native structure. Nevertheless, folding of group I introns in vitro encounters both thermodynamic and kinetic challenges. A few RNA binding proteins and chaperones have been shown to promote the folding of group I introns in vitro and in bacteria by stabilizing the native intermediates or structure, and by destabilizing the non-native structures, respectively.
'''Group I introns''' are distributed in , lower  and higher 
. However, their occurrence in  seems to be more sporadic than in lower 
, and they have become prevalent in higher . The genes that group I 
introns interrupt differ significantly: They interrupt ,  and 
genes in l genomes, as well as in l and 
genomes of lower , but only invade  genes in the nuclear genome of
lower . In higher , these introns seem to be restricted to a few
 and  genes of the s and . Both intron-early
and intron-late theories have found evidences in explaining the origin of group I introns. 
Some group I introns encode [[Homing endonuclease#Homing endonuclease genes|homing 
endonuclease]] (HEG), which catalyzes intron mobility. It is proposed that HEGs move the 
intron from one location to another, from one organism to another and thus account for the
wide spreading of the selfish group I introns. No biological role has been
identified for group I introns thus far except for splicing of themselves from the precursor
to prevent the death of the host that they live by. A small number of group I introns are 
also found to encode a class of proteins called maturases that facilitate the intron 
splicing.
