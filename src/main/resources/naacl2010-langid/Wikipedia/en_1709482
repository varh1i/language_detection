'''Jean-Baptiste André Godin''' (1817-1888) was a  industrialist and social experimentor born on the 26th of January 1817 at  (). The son of an artisan, he entered an iron-works at an early age, and at seventeen made a tour of France as journeyman. Returning to Esquéhéries in 1837, he started a small factory for the manufacture of castings for heating-stoves. The business increased rapidly, and for the purpose of railway facilities was transferred to  in 1846. At the time of Godin's death in 1888 the annual output was over four millions of s (4,160,000), and in 1908 the employees numbered over 2000 and the output was over 280,000. 
An ardent disciple of , he advanced a considerable sum of money towards the disastrous Fourierist experiment of  (q.v.) in  (known as . He profited, however, by its failure, and in 1859 started the , or community settlement, of Guise on more carefully laid plans. 
The Familistère forms a town within the town of Guise. It comprises, in addition to a large factory, three large buildings, each four stories high, capable of housing all the work-people, each family having two or three rooms. The main building consists of three rectangular blocks joined at the corners. Each of these blocks has a central court covered with a glass roof under which children can play in all weather. There is no church of any sort. (There are, of course, churches within the rest of Guise). At the back of the main block there was a nursery. There is a separate block containing various shops, refreshment rooms and recreation rooms of various kinds(?), stores for the purchase of groceries, drapery and every necessity. There were also allotments for the workers. Opposite the main block there was a building containing a theater for concerts and dramatic entertainments and a primary school. There was also a communal laundry and swimming pool. 
In 1880 the whole was turned into a co-operative society, with provision by which it eventually became the property of the workers. 
Godin manufactured cookers and heating stoves of many kinds mainly made from cast iron castings. Sometimes these were enameled. These are still to be found in use all over France. They can be found for sale on eBay.
This business was still owned by the workers in the 1950s but soon after was taken over by Le Creuset. It is not obvious that the factory is still functioning. It is seems the domestic building were privatised. The state of the domestic buildings was deteriorating but has recently been awarded EU money for it to be restored. 
In 1871 Godin was elected deputy for Aisne, but retired in 1876 to devote himself to the management of the Familistère. In 1882 he was created a .
Godin was the author of ''Solutions sociales'' (1871); ''Les Socialistes et les Droits du travail'' (1874); ''Mutualité sociale et association du capital et du travail'' (1880); ''La Republique du travail et la reforme parlementaire'' (1889).
