Please do not get fooled by the number of references in the article. Half of these references do not even mention Navneet Singh:

These references have ''exactly one sentence'' on Navneet Singh:
This reference has ''exactly two sentences'' about Navenet Singh:
It says "Navneet Singhâ€™s associates were also involved in the abduction of Romanian diplomat Liviu Radu in the year 1992[12]to publicize their cause at the world level." But Navneet Singh himself was not really important in this episode. Please search for "Liviu Radu" and see if any of the news articles contain his name. The terrorists had kidnapped the diplomat because they wanted the Indian government to release terrorists who had murdered innocents[http://www.rediff.com/news/2002/feb/05inter.htm]. When Indian government refused they still kept him to gain publicity. However, Radu was too unimportant a target for government to concede to their demands, so they had to release Radu unharmed.[http://www.thehindu.com/fline/fl2420/stories/20071019503404200.htm]
User:Singh6 is a Khalistani propagadist[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harjinder_Singh_Jinda&diff=prev&oldid=119550821][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Beant_Singh_%28assassin%29&diff=prev&oldid=130483388][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Harjinder_Singh_Jinda&diff=prev&oldid=119549905] and is trying to justify killings by terrorists. The article is written in a very propaganda manner to suit the needs of Khalistani apologists. The entire section "How he was affected by his surroundings" is  of unrelated references that do not mention Navneet Singh.
If this article is not deleted, please mention that Navneet Singh Khadian was a terrorist (as clearly mentioned by all the references that mention Navneet Singh).  () 07:37, 2 May 2008 (UTC)
