The competition was contested over 44 days between 20 different nations, over 48 fixtures. The tournament began on  at the  with a match between the host nation, France, and Argentina. The tournament culminated at the same venue on  for the Final between England and South Africa. 
The 20 nations were split up into four pools, designated A through to D, each consisting of five teams. Each pool had one semi-finalist and one quarter-finalist (automatic qualifiers) from the 2003 tournament, with the other three places filled via the qualification system. Each nation plays every other team in their pool once; each nation therefore played four matches during the pool stage.
Classification within each pool was based on the following scoring system: 
, contributing to a team's cumulative match-point score, were awarded in each of the following instances (one match point for each event): 
At the end of the pool stage, teams were ranked from first to fifth based on cumulative match points, with the top two nations proceeding to the quarter-finals.
If at the completion of the pool phase two or more Teams were level on Match points, then the following criteria would have been used in the following order until one of the Teams could be determined as the higher ranked: <ref name="rules"/>
By elevating head-to-head results (rule i) above points difference (rule ii), a notable difference is created to other sports competitions, in which points difference usually determines rank for teams with the same number of match points (table points). These rules allowed the winners of Pools A, B and C to be determined by the results of the third pool matches on the weekend of September 22 and 23.<ref>[http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/home/fixtures/knockout.html rugbyworldcup.com/Fixtures/Knockout Stages.] Retrieved 24 September 2007.</ref> Although other teams could theoretically draw level on table points with South Africa, Australia and New Zealand and exceed their points differences at the end of the pool stages, head-to-head results by that time ensured these teams could be declared winners of their respective pools, with a match to spare. This also illustrates the fact that the pool tables do not tell the whole story.
From this stage onwards, the tournament adopted a knockout format comprising eight fixtures: four quarter-finals, two semi-finals, a , and the final. The winner and runner-up from each of the four pools advanced to the quarter-finals. Pool winners were drawn against opposite pool runners-up in the quarter-finals, e.g. the winner of Pool A faced the runner up of Pool B, and the winner of Pool B faced the runner-up of Pool A. 
Each match in the knockout stage must conclude in a victory. If, after eighty minutes of normal play, a match results in a draw, further play is made to determine an outright winner. Initially, there will be two periods of , 10 minutes each way; if there is no winner after this, then play proceeds to a single 10 minute period of '' play. If the contest is unresolved after a total 110 minutes of open play, the winner will be determined by a placekicking competition.<ref name="rules"/>

There has been some controversy over the post match citings by IRB Citing Commissioners with all players not being cited for seemingly similar offences or receiving lengthy bans when other players are only sin binned (yellow carded).<ref name="leach" /><ref name="pope" /><ref name="Rees">{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Rees |title=Conspiracy theories abound as crunch fixtures approach |url=http://sport.guardian.co.uk/rugbyworldcup2007/story/0,,2177589,00.html |publisher=Planet Rugby |accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref>
Examples of inconsistencies include the citing of  against Samoa in the same game  executed what seemed to be a late tackle. Lima wasn't cited in that instance, but later received a three week ban following an almost identical tackle on England's .<ref name="naish" />
England's  received a two week ban for tripping an American player,  while  only received a yellow card for the same offence in the 2003 World Cup.<ref name="naish"/> Other examples of players being sin binned, but not receiving further punishment include Australia's  for his spear tackle on a Welsh player and New Zealand prop  for punching (a serious offence) an Italian opponent.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Morton |title=Mitchell sidesteps citing bullet |url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,22437706-5013519,00.html |publisher=Fox Sports |date= |accessdate=2007-10-03 }}</ref><ref name="Rees"/>
