This is a derivative work from a free-use map I found on Wikipedia link. I recolored it. It is a recreation of anthropologist Peter Frost's study on light hair color link. The yellow represents 80%+ light hair, light orange is 50-79% light hair, light brown is 20-49% light hair, dark brown is 1-19% light hair, and black represents no presence of light hair in the indigenous population. This version of the map only includes Europe to make it more applicable for the  article----<sup><i><font color="darkslateblue"></font></i></sup><font color="purple"></font><font color="darkslateblue"></font> 09:23, 18 August 2007 (UTC)
