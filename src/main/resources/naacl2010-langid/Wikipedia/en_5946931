He played an early role in helping bring to light malpractices carried out under the system of Indian indentured labour. In 1909, George Fitzpatrick provided testimony before a British parliamentary investigation, led by Lord Sanderson, regarding alleged mistreatment of East Indian labourers living in Trinidad. The Sanderson Committee, however, failed to bring about the immediate abolition of the indentured system, only its postponement, which was further deferred by the onset of the First World War. It was not until January 2, 1920, that the system of indentured labour would come to an end.<ref>''Emergence of an Industrial Labour Force in a Dual Economy-British India, 1880-1920 Takravarty Indian Economic Social History Review''.1978; 15: 249-327</ref> George F.
