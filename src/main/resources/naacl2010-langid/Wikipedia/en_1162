One of the key figures of the intellectual movement known as the , he is known primarily as the author of two treatises: '''' (1759), and '''', commonly known as ''The Wealth of Nations'' (1776). Smith is also known for his explanation of how rational self-interest and competition, operating in a social framework which ultimately depends on adherence to moral obligations, can lead to economic well-being and prosperity. His work helped to create the modern academic discipline of  and provided one of the best-known rationales for .

In Book V of '''', Smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at English universities, when compared to their Scottish counterparts. He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and , which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished  could make an even more comfortable living as s of the .

Smith began delivering public lectures in 1748 at  under the patronage of .<ref name="rae 1895 30"> {{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=30}}.</ref> Some of these dealt with rhetoric and '''', but he later took up the subject of "the progress of opulence", and it was then in his mid-to-late 20s that he first expounded the economic philosophy of "the obvious and simple system of natural liberty" which he would later publish in greater detail in his ''''.{{Fact|date=May 2008}} While Smith was not skillful or adept at public speaking, his lectures met with success.<ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 43">{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=43}}.</ref>
In 1750, he met the philosopher , who was his senior by more than a decade. The alignments of opinion that can be found within their writings covering history, politics, philosophy, economics, and religion indicate that they shared a closer intellectual alliance and friendship than with the others who were to play important roles during the emergence of what has come to be known as the .<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Smith, Adam (bap. 1723, d. 1790) |encyclopedia= |publisher= |date=September 2004 |author=Winch, Donald}}</ref>
In 1751, Smith earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching  courses. Then, when the  died the next year, Smith took over the position.<ref name="Bussing-Burks 2003 43"/> Smith would continue academic work for the next thirteen years, which Smith characterized as "by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honourable period [of his life]."<ref name="rae 1895 42"> {{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=42}}.</ref> His lectures covered the fields of , , , , and "police and revenue".
He published his '''' in 1759, embodying some of his  lectures. This work was concerned with how human communication depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. His analysis of language evolution was somewhat superficial, as shown only fourteen years later by a more rigorous examination of primitive language evolution by  in his ''Of the Origin and Progress of Language''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title= |encyclopedia= |publisher= |date=1972 |author=Cloyd, E.L. |pages=64–66}}</ref> Smith's capacity for fluent, persuasive, if rather rhetorical argument, is much in evidence. He bases his explanation not on a special "moral sense", as the  and Hutcheson had done, nor on  as Hume did, but on sympathy.  Smith's popularity greatly increased due to the '''', and as a result, many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith.<ref name> {{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=15}}.</ref>
After the publication of '''', Smith began to give more attention to jurisprudence and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals. An impression can be obtained about the development of his ideas on political economy from the notes of his lectures taken down by a student in 1763 which were later edited by ,<ref> {{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=67}}.</ref> and from what William Robert Scott, its discoverer and publisher, described as an early version of part of ''The Wealth of Nations''. One sentiment echoed later in that work was, "Division of labor is the great cause of the increase of public opulence, which is always proportioned to the industry of the people, and not to the quantity of gold and silver, as is foolishly imagined".<ref name>{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=13}}.</ref>
Cannan's work appeared as ''Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue and Arms''. A more complete version was published as '''' in the Glasgow Edition of 1776.

At the end of 1763, he obtained a lucrative offer from  (who had been introduced to Smith by ) to tutor his stepson, Henry Scott, the young .

Adam Smith published a large body of works throughout his life, some of which have shaped the field of economics.  Smith's first book, '''' was written in 1759.<ref> {{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=51}}.</ref> It provided the ethical, philosophical, psychological and methodological underpinnings to Smith's later works, including '''' (1776), ''A Treatise on Public Opulence'' (1764) (first published in 1937), '''' (1795), '''' (1763) (first published in 1896), and ''Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres''. In ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith critically examined the moral thinking of the time and suggested that conscience arises from social relationships.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=37&item=biography |title=Biography of Smith |accessdate=2008-05-14 |publisher= |date=1997 |author= Falkner, Robert}}</ref> Smith followed the views of his mentor,  of the , who divided moral philosophy into four parts: ethics and virtue; private rights and natural liberty; familial rights (called Oeconomicks); and state and individual rights (called Politicks).  More specifically, Smith divided moral systems into the categories of the "nature of morality" (propriety, prudence, and benevolence) and "motive of morality" (self-love, reason, and sentiment).
Shortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'', a history of  down to Smith's own era, plus some thoughts on  and , probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise.  ''Lectures on Jurisprudence'' were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of ''The Wealth of Nations'', published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Adam Smith.
In 1759, Smith published his first work, ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''. He continued to revise the work throughout his life, making extensive revisions to the final (6th) edition shortly before his death in 1790.<ref>The 6 editions of TMS were published in 1759, 1761, 1767, 1774, 1781, and 1790 respectively.

Smith's aim in the TMS is to explain the source of mankind's ability to form moral judgements, in spite of man's natural inclinations toward self-interest.  Smith proposes a theory of sympathy in which the act of observing others makes people aware of themselves and the morality of their own behavior.  Haakonssen (2002) writes in his introduction to the TMS that in Smith's theory, "one only learns to see oneself as a person and as a member of a moral universe of agents through sympathy with others’ view of one’s identity and situation in the world. Society is, as Smith says, the mirror in which one catches sight of oneself, morally speaking."<ref>Smith and Haakonssen (2002) p xv.</ref>  Through sympathy, people perceive an imaginary "impartial spectator" of themselves which forms the basis of their morality.
However, Smith qualifies that morality does not rest solely on imagining how others perceive oneself but also on one's independent judgement, provided by the ability to reason.   While others may be perceived as "the immediate judge of mankind ... an appeal lies ... to that of the supposed impartial and well-informed spectator, to that of the man within the breast..." (6th ed. p.322)  Moral judgements are formed both by imagining how others would perceive onseself and by tempering that view with one's own rational judgement.
In part because ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' emphasizes sympathy for others while ''The Wealth of Nations'' famously emphasizes the role of self interest, some scholars have perceived a conflict between these works. As one economic historian observed: "Many writers, including the present author at an early stage of his study of Smith, have found these two works in some measure basically inconsistent."<ref>Viner 1991, p. 250.</ref>
In recent years most scholars of Adam Smith's work have argued that no contradiction exists. In ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals find it in their self-interest to develop sympathy as they seek approval of the "impartial spectator." The self-interest he speaks of is not a narrow selfishness but something that involves sympathy.  As Haakonssen adds in the introduction to the TMS published by Cambridge University Press: TMS and WN "only contradict each other if Smithian sympathy is misinterpreted as benevolence and self-interest wrongly is narrowed to selfishness and then taken to be the reductive basis for all human motivation..."<ref> Smith and Haakonssen (2002) p. xxiv.</ref> Although in some contexts, such as buying and selling, sympathy generally need not be considered, Smith's espousal of self-interest is generally interpreted to be broad enough so as not to conflict with notions in the TMS.  In a published lecture,  further argued that TMS and WN together encompassed:
<blockquote>
"one behavioral axiom, 'the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another,' where the objects of trade I will interpret to include not only goods, but also gifts, assistance, and favors out of sympathy ... whether it is goods or favors that are exchanged, they bestow gains from trade that humans seek relentlessly in all social transactions. Thus, Adam Smith's single axiom, broadly interpreted ... is sufficient to characterize a major portion of the human social and cultural enterprise. It explains why human nature appears to be simultaneously self-regarding and other-regarding."<ref>Smith (1998) p. 3.</ref>
</blockquote>
Rather than viewing the ''Wealth of Nations'' and ''Theory of Moral Sentiments'' as presenting incompatible view of human nature, most Smith scholars regard the works to emphasize different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation.  The WN draws on situations where man's morality is likely to play a smaller role (such as the laborer involved in pin-making) whereas the TMS focuses on situations where man's morality is likely to play a dominant role among more personal exchanges.
Published on March 9, 1776, during the , ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' is Smith's ''''. It is a clearly written account of  at the dawn of the , and is widely considered to be the first modern work in the field of .  It is broken down into five books between two volumes. ''The Wealth of Nations'' was written for the average educated individual of the 18th century rather than for specialists and mathematicians.  There are three main concepts that Smith expands upon in this work that forms the foundation of free market economics: division of labour, pursuit of self interest, and freedom of trade.
''The Wealth of Nations'' was Smith's most influential work, and is considered to be very important in the creation of the field of economics and its development into an autonomous systematic discipline. In the Western world, it is considered one of the most influential books on the subject ever published. When the book, which has become a classic manifesto against  (the theory that large reserves of  are essential for economic success), appeared in 1776, there was a strong sentiment for  in both Britain and America. This new feeling had been born out of the economic hardships and poverty caused by the . However, at the time of publication, not everybody was immediately convinced of the advantages of free trade: the British public and Parliament still clung to mercantilism for years to come.
"Under Smith's model, government involvement in any area other than those stated above would have a negative impact on economic growth. This is because economic growth is determined by the needs of a free market and the entrepreneurial nature of private persons. If there is a shortage of a product its price will rise, and so stimulate producers to produce more, while at the same time attracting new persons into that line of production. If there is an excess supply of a product (more of the product than people are willing to buy), prices will fall and producers will focus their energy and money in other areas where there is a shortage or where there is a need which no one has yet satisfied (thereby creating a new market)."<ref>R. Conteras, "How the Concept of Development Got Started" University of Iowa Center for International Finance and Development E-Book[http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/ebook2/contents/part1-I.shtml]</ref>
''The Wealth of Nations'' also rejects the ic school's emphasis on the importance of land; instead, Smith believed labour was paramount, and that a  would effect a great increase in production. One example he used was the making of pins. One worker could probably make only twenty pins per day. However, if ten people divided up the eighteen steps required to make a pin, they could make a combined amount of 48,000 pins in one day. However, Smith also concluded that excessive division of labor would negatively affect worker's intellect through the carrying out of monotonous and repetitive tasks and hence he called for the establishment of a public education system.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}
''Nations'' was so successful, in fact, that it led to the abandonment of earlier economic schools, and later economists, such as  and , focused on refining Smith's theory into what is now known as .{{Fact|date=March 2008}} Both  and, separately,  owe significantly to classical economics. Malthus expanded Smith's ruminations on , while Ricardo believed in the ""—that overpopulation would prevent wages from topping the subsistence level. Smith postulated an increase of wages with an increase in production, a view considered more accurate today.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}
One of the main points of ''The Wealth of Nations'' is that the free market, while appearing chaotic and unrestrained, is actually guided to produce the right amount and variety of goods by a so-called "". The image of the invisible hand was previously employed by Smith in ''Theory of Moral Sentiments,'' but it has its original use in his essay, "The History of Astronomy". If a product shortage occurs, for instance, its price rises, creating a profit margin that creates an incentive for others to enter production, eventually curing the shortage. If too many producers enter the market, the increased  among manufacturers and increased supply would lower the price of the product to its production cost, the "".{{POVassertion|Cost of Production Theory and the Invisible Hand}}
Even as profits are zeroed out at the "natural price", there would be incentives to produce goods and services, as the costs of production, including compensation for the owner's labour, are also built into the price of the goods. If prices dip below a zero profit, producers would drop out of the market; if they were above a zero profit, producers would enter the market. Smith believed that while human motives are often  and , the competition in the free market would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and argued against the formation of .
Smith vigorously attacked the antiquated government restrictions which he thought were ing industrial expansion. In fact, he attacked most forms of government interference in the economic process, including s, arguing that this creates inefficiency and high prices in the long run. It is believed that this theory influenced government legislation in later years, especially during the 19th century. (However this was not an  opposition to government. Smith advocated a Government that was active in sectors other than the economy: he advocated public education of poor adults; institutional systems that were not profitable for private industries; a judiciary; and a standing army.)
An often-quoted passage in ''The Wealth of Nations'' is:
Smith postulated four "maxims" of taxation: proportionality, transparency, convenience, and efficiency. He supported low taxes and was opposed to the taxation of capital gains.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2008-05-14 |url=http://www.ncpa.org/oped/bartlett/jan2401.html |title=Adam Smith On Taxes |publisher= |date=2001-01-24 |author=Bartlett, Bruce}}</ref> Some economists credit Smith as one of the first to advocate a .<ref name="reich">{{cite web |title=Do Americans Still Believe In Sharing The Burden? |work= |date=1987-04-26 |author=Reich, Robert B. |page=d.01 |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73816461.html?dids=73816461:73816461&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+26%2C+1987&author=Robert+B.+Reich&pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&edition=&startpage=d.01&desc=Do+Americans+Still+Believe+In+Sharing+The+Burden%3F |accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Stein|first=Herbert |date= |title=Board of Contributors: Remembering Adam Smith |work= (Eastern Edition) |accessdate=2008-05-14}}</ref> Smith wrote, "It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more in proportion."

''The Wealth of Nations'', one of the earliest attempts to study the rise of industry and commercial development in Europe, was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. It provided one of the best-known intellectual rationales for free trade and , greatly influencing the writings of later economists. Smith was ranked #30 in Michael H. Hart's ,<ref>{{harvnb|Hart|1989}}</ref> and he is known as the .<ref>{{cite book |author= Pressman, Steven |title=Fifty Major Economists |date=1999 |publisher= |isbn=0415134811 |page=20}}</ref>

Some feel that the works of Adam Smith have been misinterpreted, and others argue that Adam Smith's legacy has been "lost".
In a journal article, "The Rise of Adam Smith: Articles and Citations, 1970–1997",  economist Jonathan B. Wight reports that only two articles on Adam Smith or his works were published the year before 1971. In 2002 Wight, the author  of this paper and of other books and articles  on Adam Smith  and  his works,  reports that six hundred articles and thirty books  were published in the  twenty seven years between 1970 and 1997. A heightened  interest in Adam Smith  and his works  has been sustained. And,  this  trend Wight writes is more than  a "speculative bubble"  in a 2004 conference paper titled "Is There a Speculative Bubble in Scholarship on Adam Smith?", presented at the Eleventh World Congress of Social Economics, Albertville, France.
The bicentennial anniversary of the publication of ''The Wealth of Nations''  was celebrated in 1976.  Results of this celebration   has been increased interest in Smith's first book, ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', and in his other works, throughout academia.  This heightened interest in his book on moral philosophy has also been sustained.  Or, as some say, in 1976 there was a break with the earlier emphasis on an Adam Smith problem.  After 1976 Adam Smith was more likely to be represented  as the author of both ''The Wealth of Nations'' and ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and thereby  as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics.   His "economic  man" or actor was also more often  represented as a moral person. Finally,  also pointed to was his opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire or his statements about high wages for the poor, his views that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher (Levy, Peart).<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=§Book I, Chapter 2}}.</ref> And, more than one author refer to a need to  recover "Adam Smith's lost legacy" (Kennedy, West).
In line with such trends, on ,   said the following at  the world economic  forum  in  Davos, Switzerland: "Adam Smith, the very father of capitalism and the author of ''Wealth of Nations'', who believed strongly in the value of self-interest for society, opened his first book with the following lines:
"How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortunes of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it."
Expressing  his interest  in  reducing poverty in 2008, he spoke about a "creative" capitalism, rather than  an "unfettered"  or laissez-faire capitalism.  "Creative capitalism takes this interest in the fortunes of others and ties it to our interest in our own fortunes in ways that help advance both. This hybrid engine of self-interest and concern for others can serve a much wider circle of people than can be reached by self-interest or caring alone."<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2008-05-14 |url=http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2008/01-24WEFDavos.mspx |title=Bill Gates: World Economic Forum 2008 |publisher= |date=2008-01-24 |author=}}</ref>

There, in addition,  has been a controversy over the extent of Smith's originality in ''The Wealth of Nations.''{{Fact|date=July 2008}} Some argue that the work added only modestly to the already established ideas of thinkers such as  ( 1765),  and the . Indeed, many of the theories Smith set out simply described historical trends away from mercantilism and towards free trade that had been developing for many decades and had already had significant influence on governmental policy.{{Fact|date=July 2008}} Nevertheless, Smith's work organized their ideas comprehensively, and so remains one of the most influential and important books in the field today.

It was left to Adam Smith to identify the more-general set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions. In 1776, Smith produced one of the great achievements in human intellectual history: ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations''. Most of Smith's free-market paradigm remains applicable to this day.}}
, author of the commentary ''On The Wealth of Nations'' (2007) describes Adam Smith as the "founder of free market economics" and has claimed that Smith's reasoning anticipated the Internet.<ref name="urlAdam Smith: Web Junkie - Forbes.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2007/0507/086.html |title=Adam Smith: Web Junkie - Forbes.com |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> 
However, other writers have argued that Smith's support for laissez-faire has been overstated. , in an article entitled "Adam Smith did not wear an Adam Smith necktie," wrote that the people who wear the Adam Smith tie do it "to make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and limited government. What stands out in ''The Wealth of Nations'', however, is that their patron saint was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism. He regarded his exposition of the virtues of the free market as his main contribution to policy, and the purpose for which his economic analysis was developed. "Yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system," wrote Stein. "He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie."
