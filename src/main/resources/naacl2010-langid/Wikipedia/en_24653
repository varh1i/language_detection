The '''Ural Mountains''' ({{lang-ru|Ура&#769;льские го&#769;ры}}, ''Uralskiye gory'') (also known as the '''Urals''', the '''Riphean Mountains''' in , and known as the Stone Belt) are a  that runs roughly north and south through western . They are usually considered as the natural boundary between  and .
The Urals extend 2,500&nbsp;km from the Kazakh  along the northern border of  to the coast of the .  and the  of  form a further continuation of the chain. Geographically this range marks the northern part of the border between n and an sections of the n . Its highest peak is  (Poznurr, 1,895 m). Erosion has exposed considerable mineral wealth in the Urals, including gems such as  and .The  in the northern Urals are recognized as a  site. 68% of the Ural Mountains are located in , whilst the remaining 32% are located in Kazakhstan.<ref>[http://www.peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=37 Ural Mountains - Peakbagger.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761567006/ural_mountains.html Ural Mountains - MSN Encarta<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> __NOTOC__
Geographers have divided the Urals into five regions: South, Middle, North, Subarctic and Arctic Urals. The  drops from 1,400 metres to sea level as progressing north. Sections of the south and middle regions are completely forested.
The Urals were named after the Uralian tribe that was once native to the northern region of Asia.  The Uralians were hunter-gatherers; however the lack of plentiful resources in the area forced them to relocate, spreading throughout the Asian region. According to another explanation, the word Ural is of Turkic origin and means a stone belt. <ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521829281&ss=exc The Urals and Western Siberia in the Bronze and Iron Ages - Cambridge University Press<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
The Urals are among the world's oldest extant . For its age of 250 to 300 million years, the elevation of the mountains is unusually high. They were formed during the late  period, when western  collided with eastern  (connected to  () to form the minor supercontinent of ) and  to form the supercontinent of . Later Laurasia and  collided to form the  of , which subsequently broke itself apart into the seven continents known today. Europe and  have remained joined together ever since.
The Urals were first studied in a systematic way by Russian mineralogist Ernst Karlovich Hofmann (1801-1871) of  University. During his tireless research, which began in 1828, Hofmann travelled thousands of miles in the Urals and gathered a vast collection of minerals, like , , , , , , , , , , , ,  and , among others.
The Urals have large deposits of gold, platinum, , , , , oil,and other s.
