The result of the debate was {{{1|}}} '''Speedy Keep'''. Obviously bad faith nom by a user with two edits (first, AfD notice, and second, this nom).  |  13:12, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
I know that the previous nomination of this was mired by sockpuppets. However, the argument presented there had some backing. The Department of Fun has been known to cause more harm than good, such as the Mind Benders set of subpages [over 20!] and other unencyclopedic stuff. I agree that Wikipedia needs to have some fun in it, or we would all be bored stiff! But it doesn't need an organisation co-ordinating it, and filling Wikipedia:''x'' with nonsense. I can see the Dept. of Fun becoming a 'post' for holding up nonsense in User: or WP:. Speaking of 'posts', an argument in the previous mfd was that "Jimbo Wales is a member". I feel that that argument was sort of saying "we can't delete it because Jimbo Wales is a member" and that anything that Jimbo belongs to will permanently stay. So if Jimbo belonged to Wikipedia:Association of cat murderers [not that he would be!], we would have to keep said group permanently? Although Wikipedians need to enjoy themselves, we don't need a 'Silliness central junction'.  12:03, 7 December 2006 (UTC) <small>—  ( • ) has made  outside this topic. {{ #if: {{{2|}}} | The preceding  comment was added at {{{2}}} (UTC{{{3|}}}).}}</small>
