Hello. Requesting checkuser to clear out the sock drawer and hardblock any underlying IPs. A consistently abusive user with plenty of socks. Thanks, <nowiki>|</nowiki><sup></sup> 19:57, 27 January 2008 (UTC)

Checkuser is not for fishing.  All the above users who have vandalized have been blocked.  There is no further attack by users with the name "GM" in it.  One user in the above list has not vandalized (and the name is not as offensive as the rest).  Checkuser is not necessary and actually hurts wikipedia.  Actually, if these accounts are socks, they make it easy to block based on the GM name.  If a vandal has a GM name then it's easy to justify indefinite blocking.  If we run the checkuser, then we have a precendent that you need to give escalating warnings and/or checkuser before blocking.  Let's do what is simpler, just block vandals and don't bother the checkuser.  () 22:25, 27 January 2008 (UTC)
