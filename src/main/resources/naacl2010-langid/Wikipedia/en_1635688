'''Loop 323''' is a   in  in the . It is a 19.7 mi (31.7 km) highway circling the city of  in .
In ,  (FM 1803) was established as a 4.8 mi (7.7 km)  from US 271 northeast of Tyler, to SH 64 east of Tyler. In , , was created as another bypass around the north side of Tyler, covering 7.3 mi (11.7 km) from SH 31 to US 271 and the northern end FM 1803. In October 1954, the route of FM 845 was extended (but apparently not constructed) approximately 8.0 mi (12.9 km) south and east around Tyler and then northward to intersect with the southern terminus of FM 1803. Just two months later, FM 845 was merged into FM 1803, so that the route, once completely constructed would have a single highway designation.
In , with its southern portion now under construction, FM 1803 was re-designated as Loop 323. The southern portion was to be designated as Loop 323 upon completion, while the northern portion — the original segments of the old FM 845 and FM 1803 — were re-signed to coincide with the release of the 1958 official state highway map. (In the late 1950s, highway designation changes in Texas were often timed with the release of the official state highway map.)
As of , there have been no further routing changes to Loop 323 since 1957.
The northern terminus of Loop 323 is at  and  northeast of Tyler. From there, Loop 323 travels south, intersecting its own "southern" terminus after 0.6 mi (1.0 km). Continuing south, it intersects ,  and  on the east side of Tyler; then, traveling southwest, it crosses . Shifting to a westward direction, it crosses  and  south of town, and  southwest of Tyler. Now heading north, it intersects with  and crosses SH 31, SH 64, and SH 110 for the second time each, before turning northeast and intersecting US 69 again. Approaching northeastern Tyler, Loop 323 crosses  0.7 mi (1.1 km) southwest of their previous intersection, and continues east another 0.5 mi (0.8 km) where it ends at its intersection with itself.
