I'd like to get some comments and suggestions concerning further improvement of the article. Thanks in advance.  08:36, 18 June 2007 (UTC)
I think it is a good start but it still needs a lot of copyediting. I have copyedited all of the sections except Organization and employment. I will have a go at that when i have more time.
It is a very good start though.  21:30, 20 June 2007 (UTC)
Looks really good now. I've done a bit of editing the prose for clarity; I'm sure a lot more of this can be done. However I think you should put the article up for A-class review forthwith.  21:05, 25 June 2007 (UTC)
