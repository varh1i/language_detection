The main components of automobile exhaust are  (CO<sub>2</sub>) and  water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O). Carbon dioxide is the most important   (GHG) and the most significant  emitted in the U.S. (with 82-84% of all U.S. emissions).<ref>[http://www.greenbuilder.com/sbc/newsletters/99july.html July 1999 SBC Newsletter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Increases in carbon dioxide concentration are due primarily to  use and  change.<ref> , ''{{PDF|[http://www.20minutos.es/data/adj/2007/02/02/456.pdf Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis]|2.20&nbsp;<!-- application/pdf, 2311384 bytes -->}}'' .</ref>
The CO<sub>2</sub> emission standards can be referred to the  or to the  :
CO<sub>2</sub> mass emission in vehicles is measured in '''g/km''' (g/ * 0.621371192 = g/km).
Transportation accounts for forty percent of California's annual s, and California relies on s for 96 percent of its transportation needs.
The   announced  an  that California adopt so-called Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS).<ref>[http://gov.ca.gov/index.php?/press-release/5074 Gov. Schwarzenegger Issues Directive to Establish World's First Low Carbon Standard for Transportation Fuels - Press Release by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The LCFS requires s to ensure that the mix of fuel they sell in the California Market meets, on average, a declining target for  emissions measured in  grams per unit of fuel energy sold. By '''2020''', the LCFS will produce a '''10 %''' reduction in GHG emissions from production and use of fuel in s in California.
