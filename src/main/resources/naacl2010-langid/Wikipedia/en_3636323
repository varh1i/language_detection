History
This station originally came on the air in 1949 as WHAY with studios in New Britain, CT and the transmitter at the present location on Birdseye Rd (but with the transmitter in a different building, now gone).  The call letters were changed in 1961 to WRCH and a few years later the station adoped a beautiful music format.  In 1967 new studios were constructed at the tower site on Birdseye Road.  They called the facility "Radio Towers Park".  The call letters were changed to WRCQ ("91 Q") in the 1974. After American Radio purchased the station in the late eighties the format was changed to rebroadcasting CNN Headline News.  In 1998 Mega Broadcasting purchased the station and changed the format to Spanish and the call letters to WNEZ. At that time the studios were off Route 6 in Farmington.  In 2000, Mega moved the studios to 330 Main Street in Hartford.  In 2001 Mega swapped the call letters with their other Hartford area station (1230 Manchester) and the result was that 910 became WLAT.  The station was purchased by Freedom Communications in 2002.
