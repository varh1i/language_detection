'''Entry Clearance''' is a catch-all term under UK Immigration legislation that refers to both s and s issued to persons seeking to enter the UK, the point being that while all visa nationals will require a visa to enter the UK for any purpose, there are certain circumstances where non-visa nationals also require entry clearance prior to arrival at a UK port of entry; these clearances are called entry certificates and not visas.
