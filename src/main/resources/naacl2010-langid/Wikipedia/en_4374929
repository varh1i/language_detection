<!--This is a trial new game-->
Hello and welcome to Word Association 2 (or should this be called Last Word?). This spinoff is designed to be only a slightly bit more of a challenge. As with the main association page, try finding something randomly interesting by clicking on the random article link. It may help.
Basically, nearly all the same rules apply as the main . 
As usual, the main game word count is limited to up to 400 words, although this can be less if people want. For the main game minimum word count is 200 words.
Branches are allowed with 100 words or less. '''However the minimum word count allowed is 50 words'''. In addition, do not do branches of branches, as this renders the game confusing and quite unplayable.  
'''Add one word only at a time''' which is linked to the word before. For example, , , , ...
If you are stuck on this, read  for clarity on how to link but the original word count does not apply. Only the above does.
The main difference in this is that '''when you reach the last word, it must link with the first word of the game''' (if it is really hard you can be creative as to how the last word links in with the first). Use <nowiki><!--blah--></nowiki> to show the link. '''For example: , , , ... ,  <nowiki><!--Link to first: Piano keys are made of ivory, which come from elephant tusks-->.</nowiki> '''
However <nowiki><!--blah--></nowiki> can also be used to link to the word before ''except'' for the last word.  
As usual '''in spirit of the game, please only type one word consecutively'''. Then, another person can respond to your word, and the game continues!. Finally, '''do not change the upper and lower word limits when they have been set.'''
This is Game #1.
