Monochromatic colors are all the hues (tints, tones and shades) of a single color. 
Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a single base color, and extended using its shades,tones and tints (that is, a color modified by the addition of black, grey and white). As a result, the energy is more subtle and peaceful due to a lack of color contrast. Monochromatic colors offer very little contrast and may be considered boring unless there is diversity within the design.
