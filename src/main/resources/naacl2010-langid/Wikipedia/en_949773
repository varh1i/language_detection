Official logo of the urban community found on many websites such as [http://www.lillemetropole.fr/index.php?p=11&art_id=], [http://www.agorastore.fr/Lille/conditions-generales-de-vente.aspx], [http://www.destination-lille-metropole.eu/NL/contact/index.aspx], and so on.
Fair use rationale: this logo is an essential part of the urban community infobox at the beginning of the Urban Community of Lille Métropole article. The low resolution of this logo is used in many websites to illustrate the Urban Community of Lille Métropole. There is no free version of this logo that I know of.
