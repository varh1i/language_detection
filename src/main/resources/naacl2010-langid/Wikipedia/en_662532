While there is not too many articles of reference on google, the fact that the word is used seems to indicate it does have a proper meaning, and therefore the attempt at "neologising" this word seems to be just an attempt to stifle freedom of speech. Granted, the information given on the page is slightly emotive, but surely it would be better to edit the page to include the description, rather than deleting it from the site entirely.
