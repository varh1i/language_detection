In  and , '''polyandry''' (: ''poly''- many, ''andros''- man) refers to a form of  , or other sexual union, in which one woman is married to two or more s at the same time. , on the other hand, refers to polygamy in which one man has two or more .
The form of polyandry in which two (or more) brothers marry the same woman is known as , and it is believed by many s to be the most frequently encountered form.
According to inscriptions describing the reforms of the ian king  of  (ca. 2300 BC), he is said to have abolished the former custom of polyandry in his country, on pain of the woman taking multiple husbands being stoned with rocks upon which her crime is written<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=qNAEjt_Yh5cC&pg=PA40&dq=pwers+%22walter+wink%22+%22known+law+code%22&lr=&client=firefox-a&sig=0T1Guu2UEN7KjFJVuqODn01Ec7w ''The Powers'' p. 40] by Walter Wink, 1992</ref>.

Polyandry is a controversial subject among anthropologists. For instance,  anthropologist  points out that at least 20 tribal societies accept that a child could, and ideally should, have more than one father, referring to it as "". On the other hand, in Tibet, which is the best-documented cultural domain within which polyandry is practised, the certain polyandrists themselves testify that the marriage form is difficult to sustain. {{Fact|date=April 2008}}
In Tibet polyandry has been outlawed, so it is difficult to measure the incidence of polyandry in what may have been the world's most "polyandrous" society. {{Fact|date=July 2008}}
In other parts of the world, most traditional societies have been drastically altered or destroyed, so the incidence of polyandry in the past may not be accurately known. In India, among Tibetan refugee groups who fled the Chinese takeover of their country, polyandry is seldom encountered.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}
The  prohibits . For a woman to have sexual relations when she is married to another (which would include a situation such as polyandry) would constitute , with the consequences that it would have on her status, as well as of her children from that relationship.
 also bans polyandry. In Islam the verse from the  that is typically used for a proof in this matter is Surah Nisa’ Chapter 4 verses 22 to 24, which gives the list of women with whom one cannot marry and it is further mentioned in Surah Nisa’ Chapter 4 verse 24. , a pre-Islamic tradition of polyandry, was forbidden by Islam.
There is at least one reference to polyandry in the ancient  epic, ''''.  marries the five  brothers. This ancient text remains largely neutral to the concept of polyandry, accepting this as her way of life.
Some forms of polyandry appear to be associated with a perceived need to retain  titles or  s within  groups, and/or because of the frequent absence, for long periods, of a man from the household. In Tibet the practice is particularly popular among the priestly  class but also among poor small s who can ill afford to divide their small holdings. As to the latter variety, as some males return to the household, others leave for a long time, so that there is usually one husband present.
'''Fraternal polyandry''' (from the  ''frater'' - brother) is a form of polyandry in which two or more brothers share one wife or more. It is also termed '''', but this term also has other meanings.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}
Fraternal polyandry is found especially in certain areas of  and , where polyandry is accepted as a social practice.<ref name="Levine, Nancy">Levine, Nancy, ''The dynamics of polyandry: Kinship, domesticity and population on the Tibetan border'', Chicago: 1988, University of Chicago Press.</ref>  The  of southern  practice fraternal polyandry, but monogamy has become prevalent recently.
Apart from the famous example of fraternal polyandry in , there are many more instances, both in  history and folk-lore. In contemporary Hindu society, due to sexual discrimination leading to sharp loss of number of marriageable women, many social scientists have expressed a fear of critical compulsion of polyandry in the near future.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}
Fraternal polyandry achieves a similar goal to what  did in 19th-century England. Primogeniture dictated that the eldest son inherited the family estate, while younger sons had to leave home and seek their own employment. Primogeniture maintained family estates intact over generations by permitting only one heir per generation. Fraternal polyandry also accomplishes this, but does so by keeping all the brothers together with just one wife so that there is only one set of heirs per generation.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}
In the field of behavioural ecology polyandry is a type of breeding adaptation in which one female mates with many males. Another similar breeding system to this is '''polygyny''' in which one male mates with many females (e.g., lions, deer, some primates and many systems where there is an ).
A common example of this can be found in the Field Cricket '''' of the invertebrate order Orthoptera (containing crickets, grasshoppers and groundhoppers). The unusual thing about polyandry in nature in general is that mating is costly: in other words, why mate with more than one male when you could be better spending your time foraging? Females in this species will mate with any male close to them, including siblings. Widely shown in frogs (Agile frogs, ''Rana dalmatina''), polyandry was also documented in polecat () and other mustelids. Related to , <ref> “la guerre des sexes chez les animaux” Eds O Jacob, Paris, 2006, ISBN 2-7381-1901-8</ref> found possible explanations for polyandry include mate competition and inbreeding avoidance. 
Polyandry also occurs in some primates such as s ), mammal groups, the marsupial genus' '''' and bandicoots,  around 1% of all bird species, such as jacanas, insects such as honeybees, and fish such as . In effect polyandry will reduce the effective population size of a given closed population.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}
Some s, for example , have been observed living in polyandrous groups. Although groups may contain more than one female, the dominant female suppresses ovulation in subordinates, causing her to be the only one capable of reproduction. A Goeldi's Marmoset female regularly births more than one offspring, and her eggs are separately fertilized by more than one male. Paternal investment is high among Goeldi's Marmosets, and males often carry infants on their backs even if they are not the father of the infant.   It has been suggested that multiple male mates were related, and therefore cooperation in caring for each other's young is adaptive; however, researchers tagged and tracked Goeldi's Marmosets over time, and noticed that unrelated males migrated to new groups to cooperate with non relatives as well as with relatives to care for young. It has also been suggested that females select cooperative males, and that the multiple offspring of Goeldi's Marmosets require paternal care for survival.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}
Current research suggests that polyandry is the dominant social structure in the  subfamily of New World monkeys.
The term has gained some currency in , where it refers, analogously, to a  in which one female forms more or less permanent bonds to more than one male. It can take two different forms. In one, typified by the Northern  and some other ground-living birds, the female takes on much the same role as the male in a  species, holding a large territory within which several males build nests. Subsequently, the female lays eggs in all the nests, and plays little part in . In the other form, typified by the , a group of two or more males (which may or may not be related) and one female collectively care for a single nest. The latter situation more closely resembles typical human fraternal polyandry.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} 
These two forms reflect different resource situations: polyandry with shared parental care is more likely in very difficult environments, where the efforts of more than two parents are needed to give a reasonable chance of rearing young successfully.
s are said to be polyandrous because a queen typically mates with multiple males, even though mating is the only interaction that they have (the males die off, while the queen uses stored sperm for eggs she fertilizes).
Polyandry in  and other s is usually correlated with reduced or reverse  &mdash; females larger than males. When males of a species are much larger than females,  is usually practiced. As size difference decreases, or the females are larger than males, a species is more likely to practice  or polyandry. The  (s, s, and s) are dismorphic and practice . Male and female s (lesser apes) are similar in size and form monogamous pairs. Human males and females are less dismorphic in body size than other polygynous great apes.
