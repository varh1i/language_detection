However his uncle (Press Tilton), soon informs him that he is a Traveler and must help save "Halla" ( described as every time, place and thing that ever has, or ever will, exist) from Saint Dane, the series' antagonist, who wants nothing more than to plunge each territory into chaos.
Bobby's adventures are chronicled in a collection of journals that he writes to his best friends and acolytes (assistants) on Second Earth,  and . As he follows Saint Dane from territory to territory, Bobby forms friendships with the Travelers of the other territories. He also grows wiser and becomes a better strategist every time he battles Saint Dane, although Saint Dane always seems to get the upper hand.
Bobby ages throughout the series; he turns fifteen in ''The Never War'', sixteen in ''Black Water'', seventeen by ''The Quillian Games'', and eighteen in ''Raven Rise''. 
Although Bobby is first in love with Courtney, in book 6 it was revealed that he has come to love Loor, the Traveler of Zadaa. Loor reciprocates his feelings but refuses to act upon them, stating that a relationship beyond that of a friendship would interfere with their mission. Although it seems that Bobby has "broken up" with Courtney, she seems unwilling to allow the relationship evanesce to a friendship. When reading of Bobby's feelings for Loor, she merely states, "This isn't over". At the end of ''Raven Rise'' Bobby is found together with all the Travelers, who are planning their last stand against Saint Dane.
