Jerry (Steckler as "Flagg"), his girlfriend Angela (), and his buddy Harold () head out for a day at the carnival.  In one venue, a dance number is performed by Marge (), an alcoholic who drinks before and between shows, and her partner, Bill Ward, for a small audience.  There Jerry sees  Carmelita () who hypnotizes him with her icy stare and he is compelled to see her act. Carmelita is the young sister of powerful fortune-teller Estrella (), and Estrella turns Jerry into a zombie by hypnotizing him with a spiraling wheel.   He then goes on a rampage, killing Marge and wounding Bill.  Later, Jerry  attempts to strangle his girlfriend Angela as well. It develops that Estrella, with her henchman Ortega (), has been busy turning various patrons into zombies, apparently by throwing acid on their faces.  Interspersed through the film are several song-and-dance production numbers in the carnival's nightclub, with songs like "Choo Choo Ch'Boogie" and "Shook out of Shape". The titular zombies only make an appearance in the final act, where they escape and immediately kill Estrella, Carmelita, Ortega and several performers before being shot by police. Jerry, himself partially disfigured but not a zombie, escapes the carnival and is pursued to the shoreline, where the police shoot him dead in front of Angela and Harold.

This was not, however, the originally intended title of the film.  Steckler intended to release it as ''The Incredibly Strange Creatures: Or How I Stopped Living and Became a Mixed-up Zombie,'' but changed it in response to ' threat of a lawsuit over the name's similarity to '''', which they were producing at the time.  This anecdote is related by Steckler himself on the DVD release of the film.
Brett O'Hara was usually a  for . Madame Estrella was the only "real" role of her career.{{fact|date=May 2008}}
Sharon Walsh was not originally meant to play Angela.  was given the role, but when it was time for her scene, she said she had to leave to meet her boyfriend, because he was performing and she always went to his gigs. Steckler was furious, and he pulled Walsh out of the chorus line, telling her she was now the female lead. Unfortunately, Sharon had already appeared in several dance numbers during the movie, and they had to "disguise" her with a new hairstyle.{{fact|date=May 2008}}
The cinematography/camera operating was done by three men who would go on to become major figures in cinematography: , author of '''';  (listed as William Zsigmond), who won an  for his work on '''';  and  (listed as Leslie Kovacs).{{fact|date=May 2008}}
Much of the movie was filmed in an old, long-empty  temple in , owned by actor . The nine-story building was a series of makeshift "sound stages" stacked floor after floor, some big enough to create the  scenes indoors. This was the "studio" used that year for production of '''', another film which is widely regarded as stunningly inept. "Film Center Studios" was popular with non-union producers, because they could turn off the elevator to lock out  union agents, who were too old and out of shape to climb to the seventh floor main stage.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
During the filming of the movie, Steckler was in terrible need of funds, both for the movie and for rent, food and basic needs. Atlas King, who had grown close to Dennis, gave him three hundred dollars out of his own pocket.{{fact|date=May 2008}}
The  Jerry drives in this movie was the Steckler family car.{{fact|date=May 2008}}

. . . <nowiki>[</nowiki>T<nowiki>]</nowiki>his flick doesn't just rebel against, or even disregard, standards of taste and art. In the universe inhabited by ''The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies'', such things as standards and responsibility have never been heard of. It is this lunar purity which largely imparts to the film its classic stature.
