'''Seoul Subway Line 7''' of the '''''' was built 1990-96 (Jangam-Konkuk Univ.) and was completed   (central section 17 km. Konkuk University to Sinpung); the western section between Sinpung and Onsu was put into service on  . This north-south line does not run through the city centre but links Gangnam directly to the northern parts of town. 
The future plan is an extension to Incheon Subway Line 1 to relieve the traffic congestion in western Seoul and northern Incheon. 9 stations will be added by 2010 for the 9.8 km extension, starting from Onsu Station of Line 7 and ending at Bupyeong-gu Office Station of Incheon Subway Line 1.<ref>[http://subway.seoul.go.kr/plan/plan_04.asp 서울특별시 도시철도건설본부 - "안전하고 편리한 지하철 건설"<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By that time, this line will run through 5 cities. Current length: 46.9 km.
The trains manufactured for the initial opening stage (stations Jangam and Kunkuk University) in 1996 were manufactured by DaeWoo Heavy Industries between 1995 and 1996 and they used inverters from GEC-ALSTOM.
For the second opening stage between Shinpung and Onsu and in preparation for the opening of stations Shinpung and Kunkuk University, Hanjin Heavy Industries manufactured new trains using Toshiba inverters.  Currently, all line 7 trains are being modified to be fire resistant.
